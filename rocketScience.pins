	(description "Shuttle Orbiter Discovery (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-103) is a NASA Space Shuttle.\n\nFirst flown on August 30, 1984, Discovery is the third operational space shuttle, and the oldest remaining in service. It has performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions.\n\nThe spacecraft takes its name from previous ships of exploration named Discovery, primarily HMS Discovery, a ship that accompanied explorer James Cook on his third and final major voyage. Others include Henry Hudson's ship Discovery which he used in 1610–1611 to search for a Northwest Passage, and RRS Discovery, a vessel used for expeditions to Antarctica in 1901-1904 by Scott and Shackleton (and still preserved as a museum). The shuttle shares a name with Discovery One, the spaceship from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nDiscovery was the shuttle that launched the Hubble Space Telescope. The second and third Hubble Space Telescope service missions were also conducted by Discovery. It has also launched the Ulysses probe and three TDRS satellites. Discovery has been chosen twice as the return to flight orbiter, first as the return to flight orbiter after the Challenger Disaster in 1986, and as the orbiter for the return to flight mission in July 2005, after the Columbia Disaster. Discovery also carried Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time, back into space during STS-95 on October 29, 1998, making him the oldest human being to venture into space.")

	(description "Space Shuttle Challenger (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-099) was NASA's second Space Shuttle orbiter to be put into service, after Columbia. Its maiden voyage was on April 4, 1983, and it made eight further round trips to low earth orbit before exploding 73 seconds into the launch of its tenth mission, on January 28, 1986. (For more on the Challenger disaster, see STS-51-L.) It would later be replaced by the space shuttle Endeavour, which would be launched six years after the 51-L disaster.\n\nChallenger was constructed using a body frame (STA-099) that had initially been built as a test article. STA-099 had not been meant for spaceflight, but NASA discovered that recycling it would be cheaper than refitting the test shuttle Enterprise (OV-101) to be spaceworthy, as originally planned.\n\nChallenger is one of two space shuttles destroyed in an accident during a mission, the other being Columbia. The collected debris of the vessel are currently stored in decommissioned missile silos at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. From time to time, further pieces of debris from the orbiter wash up on the Florida coast. When this happens, they are collected and transported to the silos for storage.")

	(biography "Robert Laurel Crippen (b. 11 September 1937 in Beaumont, Texas) (Captain, USN, retired) is a retired astronaut, and has been a crew member of the space shuttle on four missions, including three as commander.\n\nHe was previously president of Thiokol Propulsion where he served from December, 1996 to April, 2001. Thiokol produces the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motors and other defense and commercial solid rocket motors.\n\nPrior to joining Thiokol, he served as a Vice President with Lockheed Martin Information Systems in Orlando, Florida from April, 1995 to November, 1996.\n\nCrippen served as the director of NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center from January 1992 to January 1995. In this position he was responsible for all activities occurring on the U.S.'s gateway to the universe. During his tenure, the center processed, safely launched, and recovered 22 Space Shuttle missions. He provided leadership for over thirteen thousand civil service and contractor personnel. This included oversight of multiple contracts supporting center operations for both manned and unmanned spaceflight. He also implemented cost savings of greater than 25% by establishing and developing new quality management techniques while ensuring the highest safety standards in an extremely hazardous environment.\n\nFrom January 1990 to January 1992 he served as Director, Space Shuttle, at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In this headquarters post he was responsible for the overall Shuttle program requirements, performance, and total program control, including budget, schedule and program content. He was stationed at KSC from July 1987 to December 1989, serving as Deputy Director, Shuttle Operations for NASA Headquarters. He was responsible for final Shuttle preparation, mission execution and return of the orbiter to KSC following landings at Edwards Air Force Base, California.\n\nBorn September 11, 1937, in Beaumont, Texas, Crippen received a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1960. He was commissioned through the U.S. Navy's Aviation Officer Program. As a Navy pilot from June 1962 to November 1964, he completed a tour of duty aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence flying A-4s in VA-72. He later attended the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Upon graduation he remained at Edwards as an instructor until his selection for the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Program in October 1966.\n\nCrippen became a NASA astronaut in September 1969. He was a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, 3, and 4 missions and for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. He was the pilot of the first orbital test flight of the Shuttle program (STS-1, April 12–14, 1981) and was the commander of three additional shuttle flights: STS-7, June 18–24, 1983; STS-41C, April 6–13, 1984; and STS-41G, October 6–13, 1984.\n\nHis accomplishments have earned him many notable awards: the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1972; five awards in 1981, including the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Award, The American Astronautical Society of Flight Achievement Award, The National Geographic Society's Gardiner Greene Hubbard Medal, and induction into the Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1982 he won the Federal Aviation Administration's Award for Distinguished Service, the Goddard Memorial Trophy and the Harmon Trophy. In 1984 he received the U.S. Navy Distinguished Flying Cross and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. He also received NASA's Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1988 and three Distinguished Service Medals in 1985, 1988, and 1993. He is also a fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, American Astronautical Society and Society of Experimental Test Pilots.

	(description "Space Shuttle Columbia (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-102) was the first space shuttle in NASA's orbital fleet. Its first mission, STS-1, lasted from April 12 to April 14, 1981. On February 1, 2003, Columbia disintegrated during re-entry on its 28th mission; all seven crew members aboard were killed (see Space Shuttle Columbia disaster).\n\nConstruction began on Columbia in 1975 primarily in Palmdale, California. Columbia was named after the Boston-based sloop Columbia captained by American Robert Gray, which explored the Pacific Northwest and became the first American vessel to circumnavigate the world; the name also honoured Columbia, the Command Module of Apollo 11. After construction, the orbiter arrived at John F. Kennedy Space Center on March 25, 1979 to prepare for its first launch. However, before its first mission, two workers were killed and four injured during a ground test of the orbiter on March 19, 1981.\n\nThe first flight of Columbia was commanded by John Young (a space veteran from the Gemini and Apollo eras) and piloted by Robert Crippen, a rookie who had never been in space before, but who served as a support crew member for the Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz.\n\nIn 1983, Columbia launched the first mission (STS-9) with 6 astronauts, including the first non-American astronaut on a space shuttle, Ulf Merbold. On January 12, 1986 Columbia took off with the first Hispanic American astronaut, Dr. Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, as well as the first sitting member of the House of Representatives in space, Bill Nelson. Another first was announced on March 5, 1998 when NASA named their choice of U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Eileen Collins as commander of a future Columbia mission making Collins the first woman commander of a space shuttle mission.")

A mural in the captain's office (known as the Ready room) in Star Trek: Enterprise, in addition to a painting seen briefly in the crew's lounge of the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (released only two years after the Enterprise shuttle tests) depicts this Space Shuttle as one of the starship's own namesakes, and images in the opening credits of the series Star Trek: Enterprise pay similar tribute. Oddly, Star Trek: Enterprise later pictured a model of the International Space Station with the Space Shuttle Enterprise docked with it, despite the fact that Enterprise has never been fitted for launch into space.")

	(description "Shuttle Orbiter Endeavour (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-105) is the fifth and final operational NASA space shuttle to be built.\n\nThe United States Congress authorized the construction of Endeavour in 1987 to replace Challenger, which was lost in an accident in 1986. Structural spares from the construction of shuttles Discovery and Atlantis were used in its assembly. The decision to build Endeavour was favored over refitting Enterprise because it was cheaper.\n\nEndeavour was delivered in May 1991 and first launched in May 1992. On its first mission captured and redeployed the stranded INTELSAT VI communications satellite. The Space Shuttle wasn't designed to retrieve the satellite, however, which created many repair challenges. In 1993 it made the first service mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. Endeavour was withdrawn from service for eight months in 1997 for a retrofit, including installation of a new airlock. In December 1998, it delivered the Unity Module to the International Space Station.\n\nEndeavour was named through a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools. The orbiter is named after the HM Bark Endeavour, the ship commanded by 18th century explorer James Cook; the name also honored Endeavour, the Command Module of Apollo 15. Due to this origin, the name is spelt in the British English manner, rather than the American English spelling of \"Endeavor\".\n\nAs of August 2005, Endeavour is still in its Orbiter Major Modification period, which began in December 2003 and is expected to last through sometime in 2006.")

	(description "Shuttle Orbiter Atlantis (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-104) is one of five NASA space shuttles. It was the fourth operational shuttle built and as of 2005 is one of only three shuttles remaining in the fleet.\n\nAtlantis was named in honor of the first United States oceanographic research vessel, a two-masted sailing ship operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1930 to 1966.\n\nAs the fourth shuttle, Atlantis benefited from experience gained in the construction of its predecessors. On roll-out it weighed nearly 7,000 lb (3 t) less than the first operational shuttle, Columbia, and required about half the time to build. Structural spare parts also built along with Atlantis were used in the later construction of the fifth shuttle, Endeavour.\nShuttle orbiter Atlantis landing in 1997\nEnlarge\nShuttle orbiter Atlantis landing in 1997\n\nAtlantis made its first flight in October 1985, conducting classified military activities, one of five such flights. In 1989 Atlantis deployed two planetary probes, Magellan and Galileo, and in 1991 it deployed the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.\n\nBeginning in 1995, Atlantis made seven straight flights to the Russian space station Mir. On the second Mir flight it delivered a docking module and on the subsequent flights it conducted astronaut exchanges.\n\nFrom November 1997 to July 1999, Atlantis underwent refitting operations, with about 165 modifications made to the shuttle, including the installation of the Multifunction Electronic Display System, or glass cockpit. It has made six flights since then, all involving assembly activities at the International Space Station.\n\nIn its most recent flight, in October 2002, Atlantis and its six-person crew completed an 11-day mission to the International Space Station that involved three space walks.\n\nNASA scheduled the 27th launch for Atlantis for September 2005, during the window of September 9 - 24. It is unlikely to fly on schedule, due to the complications during Discovery's launch of mission STS-114 and NASA's subsequent suspension of all future shuttle launches. It is the designated STS-300 rescue orbiter for the STS-114 mission.")

The launch resulted tragically in the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster when the vehicle exploded 73 seconds after launch on January 28, 1986, a result of the failure of an O-ring seal in the right solid rocket booster (SRB). This caused a leak with a flame that caused another leak in the hydrogen tank. Among the crew was Christa McAuliffe, scheduled to be the first teacher in space. Students worldwide watched the shuttle launch and subsequent explosion on live television.\n\nMission objectives\n\nPlanned objectives were deployment of Tracking Data Relay Satellite-2 (TDRS-2) and flying of Shuttle-Pointed Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-203)/Halley's Comet Experiment Deployable, a free-flying module designed to observe tail and coma of Halleys comet with two ultraviolet spectrometers and two cameras. Other payloads were Fluid Dynamics Experiment (FDE); Comet Halley Active Monitoring Program (CHAMP); Phase Partitioning Experiment (PPE); three Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments; and set of lessons for Teacher in Space Project (TISP).\n[edit]\n\nLaunch\nBlack smoke from the starboard Solid Rocket Booster (on the left in this image) obscures the orange of the external tank near the bottom of the tank.\nEnlarge\nBlack smoke from the starboard Solid Rocket Booster (on the left in this image) obscures the orange of the external tank near the bottom of the tank.\n\nChallenger launched January 28, 1986, at 11:38:00 a.m. EST, the first Shuttle to launch from pad 39-B (and the first launch of any sort from this facility since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission in 1975). Launch was originally set for 3:43 p.m. EST, Jan. 22; it slipped to Jan. 23, then Jan. 24, due to delays in mission STS-61-C. Launch was reset for Jan. 25 because of bad weather at transoceanic abort landing (TAL) site in Dakar, Senegal. To utilize Casablanca (not equipped for night landings) as alternate TAL site, T-zero moved to a morning liftoff time. Launch was postponed a day when launch processing was unable to meet the new morning liftoff time. A prediction of unacceptable weather at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) led managers to reschedule launch for 9:37 a.m. EST, January 27. Launch was delayed 24 hours again when a ground servicing equipment hatch closing fixture could not be removed from the orbiter hatch. Maintenance crews sawed off and drilled out the attaching bolt before completing closeout. During the delay, cross winds exceeded return-to-launch-site limits at KSC's Shuttle Landing Facility. Launch January 28 was delayed two hours when hardware interface module in the launch processing system, which monitors fire detection system, failed during liquid hydrogen tanking procedures.\n\nJust after liftoff, at 0.678 seconds into the flight, photographic data show a large puff of gray smoke spurted from the vicinity of the aft field joint on the right Solid Rocket Booster (SRB). Computer graphic analysis of film from pad cameras indicated the initial smoke came from the 270- to 310-degree sector of the circumference of the aft field joint of the right SRB. This area of the SRB faces the Space Shuttle External Tank. The vaporized material streaming from the joint indicated there was incomplete sealing action within the joint.\n\nEight more distinctive puffs of increasingly blacker smoke were recorded between 0.836 and 2.500 seconds. The smoke appeared to puff upwards from the joint. While each smoke puff was being left behind by the upward flight of the Shuttle, the next fresh puff could be seen near the level of the joint. The multiple smoke puffs in this sequence occurred at about four times per second, approximating the frequency of the structural load dynamics and resultant joint flexing. As the Shuttle increased its upward velocity, it flew past the emerging and expanding smoke puffs. The last smoke was seen above the field joint at 2.733 seconds.\n\nIt was later determined that an O-ring seal in the right SRB had failed, losing pliability due to the cold weather. As the O-ring could not flex and expand, a gap opened in the SRB which could not be sealed by the O-ring, and superheated gases were able to escape for 2.5 seconds. The black color and dense composition of the smoke puffs suggest that the grease, joint insulation and rubber O-rings in the joint seal were being burned and eroded by the hot propellant gases. The gap was blocked by aluminium oxide particles generated by the burning fuel.\n\nAt approximately 37 seconds, Challenger encountered the first of several high-altitude wind shear conditions, which lasted until about 64 seconds. The wind shear created forces on the vehicle with relatively large fluctuations. These were immediately sensed and countered by the guidance, navigation and control system. The steering system (thrust vector control) of the SRBs responded to all commands and wind shear effects. The wind shear caused the steering system to be more active than on any previous flight.\nPhotograph of the 51-L launch at 58.82 seconds after launch shows an unusual plume in the lower part of the right hand SRB.\nEnlarge\nPhotograph of the 51-L launch at 58.82 seconds after launch shows an unusual plume in the lower part of the right hand SRB.\n\nBoth the Shuttle main engines and the solid rockets operated at reduced thrust approaching and passing through the area of maximum dynamic pressure of 720 lbf/ft² (34 kPa). Main engines had been throttled up to 104 percent thrust and the SRBs were increasing their thrust. At this point, the aluminium oxide particles plugging the gap in the right SRB were jarred loose by the high winds, and the first flicker of flame appeared on the right SRB in the area of the aft field joint. This first very small flame was detected on image-enhanced film at 58.788 seconds into the flight. It appeared to originate at about 305 degrees around the booster circumference at or near the aft field joint.\n\nOne film frame later from the same camera, the flame was visible without image enhancement. It grew into a continuous, well-defined plume at 59.262 seconds. At about the same time (60 seconds), telemetry showed a pressure differential between the chamber pressures in the right and left boosters. The right booster chamber pressure was lower, confirming the growing leak in the area of the field joint.\n\nAs the flame plume increased in size, it was deflected rearward by the aerodynamic slipstream and circumferentially by the protruding structure of the upper ring attaching the booster to the External Tank. These deflections directed the flame plume onto the surface of the External Tank. This sequence of flame spreading is confirmed by analysis of the recovered wreckage. The growing flame also impinged on the strut attaching the Solid Rocket Booster to the External Tank.\n\nThe first visual indication that swirling flame from the right Solid Rocket Booster breached the External Tank was at 64.660 seconds when there was an abrupt change in the shape and color of the plume. This indicated that hydrogen was now leaking from the External Fuel Tank (due to the flame) and was mixing with it. Telemetered changes in the hydrogen tank pressurization confirmed the leak. Within 45 milliseconds of the breach of the External Tank, a bright sustained glow developed on the black-tiled underside of the Challenger between it and the External Tank.\nSmoke enveloped the orbiter and external tank at 73 seconds after launch.\nEnlarge\nSmoke enveloped the orbiter and external tank at 73 seconds after launch.\n\nBeginning at about 72 seconds, a series of events occurred extremely rapidly that terminated the flight. Telemetered data indicate a wide variety of flight system actions that support the visual evidence of the photos as the Shuttle struggled futilely against the forces that were destroying it.\n\nAt about 72.20 seconds the hydrogen tank was weakening and the lower strut linking the Solid Rocket Booster and the External Tank was severed or pulled away, permitting the right Solid Rocket Booster to rotate around the upper attachment strut. This rotation is indicated by divergent yaw and pitch rates between the left and right Solid Rocket Boosters.\n\nAt 73.124 seconds, a circumferential white vapor pattern was observed blooming from the side of the External Tank bottom dome. This was the beginning of the structural failure of hydrogen tank that culminated in the entire aft dome dropping away. This released massive amounts of liquid hydrogen from the tank and created a sudden forward thrust of about 2.8 million pounds force (12 MN), pushing the hydrogen tank upward into the intertank structure. At about the same time, the rotating right SRB impacted the intertank structure and the lower part of the liquid oxygen tank. These structures failed at 73.137 seconds as evidenced by the white vapors appearing in the intertank region.\n\nWithin milliseconds there was massive, almost explosive, burning of the hydrogen streaming from the failed tank bottom, and liquid oxygen breach in the area of the intertank.\n\nAt this point in its trajectory, while traveling at a Mach number of 1.92 at an altitude of 46,000 ft (14 km), the Challenger was totally enveloped in the explosive burn. The Challenger's reaction control system ruptured and a hypergolic burn of its propellants occurred as it exited the oxygen-hydrogen flames. The reddish brown colors of the hypergolic fuel burn are visible on the edge of the main fireball. The Orbiter, under severe aerodynamic loads, broke into several large sections which emerged from the fireball. Separate sections that can be identified on film include the main engine/tail section with the engines still burning, one wing of the Orbiter, and the forward fuselage trailing a mass of umbilical lines pulled loose from the payload bay.\nMain engine exhaust, solid rocket booster plume and an expanding ball of gas from the external tank is visible seconds after the explosion.\nEnlarge\nMain engine exhaust, solid rocket booster plume and an expanding ball of gas from the external tank is visible seconds after the explosion.\n\nThe explosion 73 seconds after liftoff destroyed the vehicle. The still-burning SRBs, separated from the tank in the explosion, were destroyed with on-board explosives designed for this emergency purpose (the Range Safety System) by remote command from NASA.\n\nThe crew cabin, separated from the orbiter, survived the explosion intact and fell into the ocean. Whether the crew survived the breakup is unclear, the official report by Joseph P. Kerwin [[1]] states that:\n\n    * \"the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury and\"\n    * \"the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure\".\n\nRecovered debris show that at least two of the astronauts survived long enough to turn on their Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPS, designed for on-pad emergencies). Three PEAPS were activated, however: Resnik's, Onizuka's, and Smith's. Being that Smith's activation switch was located on the back of his seat, it is likely that either Resnik or Onizuka activated Smith's pack in an attempt to save his life. It is important to note that PEAPS would not have provided life-sustaining air for the crew, as they only provide unpressurized air. They are intended to simply give astronauts breathing air on the launch pad should noxious gases flood the cabin. It is highly likely that the cabin depressurized due to the blast, and that all of the astronauts were unconscious at the time of splashdown, though there continues to be debate regarding this subject. Astronaut Robert Crippen theorized that had the cabin not depressurized, there would have been no reason to active the PEAPS, thus solidifying the possibility that the astronauts were making a \"desperate\" attempt to save their own lives, and the chances that any were conscious at splashdown (due to the complete loss of cabin pressure) are nonexistant.\n\nRegardless of the crew's consciousness during the descent, the splashdown would have generated at least 200 times the force of gravity, instantly killing any of the astronauts that may have been alive (conscious or not). [2]\n\nOrbiter launch weight was 268,829 lb (121,939 kg).\n[edit]\n\nLanding\n\nNone. A landing at KSC was planned after a mission of 6 days, 34 minutes.\n[edit]\n\nExpected mission highlights\nPlaque of the Challenger and Columbia crews at KSC\nEnlarge\nPlaque of the Challenger and Columbia crews at KSC\n\nOn Flight Day 1, after arriving into orbit, the crew was to have two periods of scheduled high activity. First they were to check the readiness of the TDRS-B satellite prior to planned deployment. After lunch they were to deploy the satellite and its Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) booster and to perform a series of separation maneuvers. The first sleep period was scheduled to be eight hours long starting about 18 hours after crew wakeup the morning of launch.\n\nOn Flight Day 2, the Comet Halley Active Monitoring Program (CHAMP) experiment was scheduled to begin. Also scheduled were the initial \"teacher in space\" (TISP) video taping and a firing of the orbital maneuvering engines (OMS) to place Challenger at the 152 mile (282 km) orbital altitude from which the Spartan would be deployed.\n\nOn Flight Day 3, the crew was to begin pre-deployment preparations on the Spartan and then the satellite was to be deployed using the remote manipulator system (RMS) robot arm. Then the flight crew was to slowly separate from Spartan by 90 miles (167 km).\n\nOn Flight Day 4, the Challenger was to begin closing on Spartan while Gregory B. Jarvis continued fluid dynamics experiments started on days two and three. Live telecasts were also planned to be conducted by Christa McAuliffe, giving lessons to her students from orbit.\n\nOn Flight Day 5, the crew was to rendezvous with Spartan and use the robot arm to capture the satellite and re-stow it in the payload bay.\n\nOn Flight Day 6, re-entry preparations were scheduled. This included flight control checks, test firing of maneuvering jets needed for reentry, and cabin stowage. A crew news conference was also scheduled following the lunch period.\n\nOn Flight Day 7, the day would have been spent preparing the Space Shuttle for deorbit and entry into the atmosphere. The Challenger was scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center 144 hours and 34 minutes after launch.\n[edit]\n\nInvestigation\nDebris recovered from Space Shuttle Challenger was moved from Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39 to permanent storage in two secure abandoned Minuteman Missile silos at Complex 31 on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\nEnlarge\nDebris recovered from Space Shuttle Challenger was moved from Kennedy Space Center's Complex 39 to permanent storage in two secure abandoned Minuteman Missile silos at Complex 31 on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\nAfter the investigation, a Presidential Commission created the Rogers Commission Report detailing NASA's failings. The investigation and corrective actions following the Challenger accident caused a 32-month hiatus in shuttle launches: the next mission was September 29, 1988, when Discovery set off on mission STS-26. Reforms to NASA procedures were enacted which attempted to preclude another occurrence of such an accident, and the Shuttle program would continue without serious incident until the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster on February 1, 2003.\n[edit]\n\nControversy\n\nSince recovered debris show that at least three of the astronauts survived long enough to turn on their Personal Egress Air Packs (PEAPS, designed for on-pad emergencies) and were likely alive but unconscious until final splashdown, there has been a significant amount of debate and speculation over the survivability of the STS-51-L disaster.\n\nThe number of crew members surviving until sea impact has been one of the most strongly debated subjects in Internet newsgroups. The need for a reinforced cockpit section and some kind of an emergency rescue system (either in the form of detachable, parachute-equipped cabin as used by the F-111 fighter-bomber or individual ejection seats, similar to K-36RB (Zvezda K-36M-11F35) devices mounted on the ex-Soviet Buran space shuttle) is often advocated by amateurs and space professionals alike.\n\nBill Kaysing, best known for his claims that the Apollo moon landings were faked, claimed in an interview [3] that NASA deliberately destroyed the Challenger, as Christa McAuliffe would not agree to say that you cannot see stars in space (presumably this \"lie\" was to back up the fact that there are no stars in \"faked\" photographs of astronauts on the Moon). This claim is generally not believed - Kaysing made the error of saying that McAuliffe was the only woman onboard Challenger.\n\nAt least three different texts, each one claiming to be the exact transcript of STS-51-L on-board voice communications, have appeared on the Internet. These purported transcripts describe the astronauts' last moments as a mixture of prayers and vocal struggle trying to save their vessel. However, NASA denies both the authenticity of these transcripts and the existence of any recordings after the 73 second point, when the breakup-induced power loss stopped the recorders. NASA has made available an official transcript [4], compiled from the various voice recorders onboard, and covering the period from 125 seconds before until 73 seconds after launch. Only 4 of the crewmembers actually speak, though. The last recorded remark is by the mission's pilot, Michael Smith, who says, simply, \"Uh-oh.\"\n[edit]\n\nTribute\nThe Challenger crewmember remains are being transferred from 7 hearse vehicles to a MAC C-141 transport plane at the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility for transport to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\nEnlarge\nThe Challenger crewmember remains are being transferred from 7 hearse vehicles to a MAC C-141 transport plane at the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility for transport to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\n\nOn the night of the disaster, United States President Ronald Reagan was supposed to give his State of the Union address. Instead, he postponed it for a week and gave a poignant national address from the Oval Office of the White House.[5] At its end, he made the following statement, quoting from the poem \"High Flight\" by John Gillespie Magee, Jr.: We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\" This speech has been remembered as one of the greatest addresses of his presidency. Three days later, he and his wife, Nancy traveled to the LBJ Space Center for a memorial service to honor the astronauts.\n\nNichelle Nichols of Star Trek was involved in the NASA recruitment process of Astronauts during the late 1970s to the early 80s and helped recruit both Ronald McNair and Judith Resnik. When Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was released it bore the dedication at the beginning, \"The cast and crew of Star Trek wish to dedicate this film to the men and women of the spaceship Challenger whose courageous spirit shall live to the 23rd century and beyond....\". One shuttlecraft from Star Trek: The Next Generation was named Onizuka, after Ellison Onizuka, one of the crew members of the Challenger.")

He is also an Instructor of Parachute Training, and has completed 377 parachute jumps.\n\nIn August 1996 Korzun completed training as Commander for the Mir-22/ NASA-3 and \"Cassiopia\" (sponsored by CNES) programs.\n\nOn March 2, 1997 Korzun returned to earth after completing a 197-day flight onboard the Mir space station. The program included joint flights with NASA/MIR 2, 3 and 4 astronauts, as well as astronauts from France and Germany. During the mission, Korzun performed 2 space walks totaling 12 hours and 33 minutes.\n\nThe Expedition 5 crew launched on June 5, 2002 aboard STS-111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. Korzun performed two EVAs during his six-month stay aboard the Space Station. He and Whitson installed six debris panels onto the ISS Zvezda Service Module. They removed the panels from their temporary location on the station's pressurized Mating Adapter 1 prior to attachment to Zvezda. The panels are designed to shield Zvezda from potential space debris impacts. On his second EVA he and Sergei Treschev installed a frame on the outside of the Zarya Module to house components for future spacewalk assembly tasks. They installed new material samples on a pair of Japanese Space Agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of Zvezda. They installed devices on Zvezda that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks. They also improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on Zvezda. The Expedition-Five crew (one American Astronaut and two Russian Cosmonauts) returned to Earth on December 7, 2002 aboard STS-113. Completing his second flight, Korzun logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space, including two EVAs totaling 9 hours and 46 minutes.\n\nDECEMBER 2002")

With Commander Jim Wetherbee and Pilot Paul Lockhart at the controls, Endeavour docked with the station on November 25 to begin seven days of station assembly, spacewalks and crew and equipment transfers.\n\n\nSTS-113 was an Assembly Mission (11A) to the International Space Station, delivering the P1 Truss segment, which provides structural support for the Space Station radiators. Mission Specialists John Herrington and Michael Lopez-Alegria performed three spacewalks to activate and outfit the P1. The STS-113 crew and both Expedition crews transferred about 1,969 kilograms (4,340 pounds) of cargo between the shuttle and station.\n\nSTS-113 delivered the Expedition 6 crew to the station for a four-month increment. The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-113, ending an 185-day stay in space.\n\nSTS-113 came to a close when Space Shuttle Endeavour glided in to a landing at Kennedy Space Center on December 7. It was the 19th flight of Endeavour, the 112th shuttle mission, and the 16th shuttle mission to the station. The landing was the first time a mission ended on the fourth day of landing attempts.\n\nAlso carried aboard STS-113 was the Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS) based Pico Satellite Inspector. This payload deployed two small satellites which are connected via a 50 ft (15 m) tether.")

The crew also transferred cargo between the two vehicles and used the shuttle's thruster jets during two maneuvers to raise the station's orbit. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The STS-112 mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.\n\nOCTOBER 2002")

Additional objectives included the deploy and retrieval of SPARTAN-201, a free-flying satellite that investigated the physics of the solar corona, and the testing of a new EVA maneuvering device. The Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX) was used to collect extensive data on the effects of jet thruster impingement, in preparation for proximity tasks such as space station docking. Mission duration was 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes.\n\nSTS-78 Columbia, June 20 to July 7, 1996, Helms was the payload commander and flight engineer aboard Columbia, on the longest Space Shuttle mission to date. The mission included studies sponsored by ten nations and five space agencies, and was the first mission to combine both a full microgravity studies agenda and a comprehensive life science investigation. The Life and Microgravity Spacelab mission served as a model for future studies on board the International Space Station. Mission duration was 16 days, 21 hours, 48 minutes.\n\nSTS-101 Atlantis, May 19-29, 2000, was a mission dedicated to the delivery and repair of critical hardware for the International Space Station. Helms prime responsibilities during this mission were to perform critical repairs to extend the life of the Functional Cargo Block (FGB). In addition, she had prime responsibility of the onboard computer network and served as the mission specialist for rendezvous with the ISS. Mission duration was 9 days, 20 hours and 9 minutes.\n\nHelms lived and worked onboard the International Space Station as a member of the second crew to inhabit the International Space Station Alpha. The Expedition 2 crew (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) launched on March 8, 2001 onboard STS-102 Discovery and successfully docked with the station on March 9, 2001. The Expedition-2 crew installed and conducted tests on the Canadian made Space Station Robotic arm (SSRMS), conducted internal and external maintenance tasks (Russian and American), in addition to medical and science experiments.

	(biography "Eileen Marie Collins (b. 19 November 1956 in Elmira, New York) is an American astronaut and a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel. A former military instructor and test pilot, Collins was the first female pilot and first female commander of a Space Shuttle.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Early life\n    * 2 Air Force experience\n    * 3 Astronaut experience\n    * 4 Personal life\n    * 5 Awards and honors\n    * 6 References\n    * 7 External Links\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\nCollins' parents are James Collins, a surveyor and postal worker, and Rose Marie. She has three siblings. As a child, Collins expressed an interest both in space flight and in being a pilot.\n\nAfter graduating from Elmira Free Academy in 1974, Collins attended Corning Community College where she earned an associate degree in mathematics/science in 1976. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1978 and then earned a master of science degree in operations research from Stanford University in 1986 and a master of arts degree in space systems management from Webster University in 1989.\n[edit]\n\nAir Force experience\n\nCollins completed her U.S. Air Force undergraduate pilot training in 1979, after which she was a T-38 instructor pilot until 1982. From 1983 to 1985, Collins was an instructor pilot and aircraft commander on the C-141 Starlifter. From 1986 to 1989, she was an assistant professor of mathematics and a T-41 instructor pilot at the U.S. Air Force Academy. She was selected for NASA's astronaut program while attending the prestigious U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, from which she graduated in 1990. She has logged more than 6,000 hours in 30 different types of aircraft.\n\nCollins also participated in the U.S. invasion of Grenada, evacuating medical students and their families off the island as part of Operation Urgent Fury in 1983.\n\nShe retired from the Air Force as a Colonel in January 2005.\n[edit]\n\nAstronaut experience\n\nCollins first flew the Space Shuttle as pilot in 1995 aboard STS-63, which involved a rendezvous between Discovery and the Russian space station Mir. In recognition of her achievement as the first female Shuttle Pilot, she received the Harmon Trophy. She was also the pilot for STS-84 in 1997.\n\nCollins next commanded STS-93, launched in July 1999, which deployed the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. This was Shuttle Columbia's penultimate completed mission, the final one being STS-109, which flew in March 2002. The Columbia was later lost in the Columbia disaster (STS-107) on 1 February 2003.\n\nCollins recently commanded STS-114, NASA's \"return to flight\" mission to test safety improvements and resupply the International Space Station (ISS). The flight was launched on 26 July 2005, and returned on 9 August 2005. During STS-114, Collins became the first astronaut to fly the space shuttle through a complete 360-degree pitch maneuver. This was necessary so astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of the shuttle's belly, to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage to the shuttle upon re-entry.\n[edit]\n\nPersonal life\n\nCollins married pilot Pat Youngs in 1988; the couple have two children, Bridget (born 1995) and Luke (born 2000). Bridget was born several months after Eileen's first shuttle mission, making Eileen quite possibly the first person to be pregnant in space. Female astronauts are now required to fail a pregnancy test before each mission.\n[edit]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nCollins has received the Defense Superior Service Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for service in Grenada (Operation Urgent Fury), the French Legion of Honor, and NASA's Outstanding Leadership Medal and Space Flight Medals.\n\nThe main entrance boulevard to Syracuse Hancock International Airport is named in Collins' honor.")

The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.\n\nSRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.\n\nThe SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.\n\nThe imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can \"see\" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.\n\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.\n\nAn international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.\n\nThe MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of \"greenhouse gases,\" chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.\n\nSTS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission. Other GAS hardware in Endeavour's payload bay will carry 500,000 commemorative stamps for the U.S. Postal Service in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n\nOther payloads aboard Endeavour include the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) which will fly for the first time, and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST) which will be making its second flight. BRIC experiments, sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, are designed to examine the effects of microgravity on a wide range of physiological processes in higher order plants and arthropod animals (e.g., insects, spiders, centipedes, crustaceans). MAST is an experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and is part of a five-year research program developed by ONR to examine the effects of ships on the marine environment.\n\nThe Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment, the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) and the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment also will be carried aboard Endeavour.")

In 1978, he was assigned to Attack Squadron 56, embarked in the USS Midway, homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, where he flew the A-7 Corsair II. In late 1980 he was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 30 as the air wing landing signal officer. He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1981 and, after graduation, was assigned to the Carrier Suitability Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. While there, Baker conducted carrier suitability structural tests, aircraft carrier catapult and arresting gear certification tests, and automatic carrier landing system certification and verification tests on the various aircraft carriers of the Navy’s fleet in the A-7 Corsair II aircraft. In 1983, he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as an instructor. He was then assigned as the U.S. Navy exchange instructor at the Empire Test Pilots School in Boscombe Down, England, teaching performance, flying qualities and systems flight test techniques.\n\nHe has logged over 5,400 hours flying time in approximately 50 different types of airplanes, including tactical jets, VSTOL, multi-engine transport and rotary wing aircraft, and has over 300 carrier landings to his credit.\n[edit]\n\nNASA Experience\n\nSelected by NASA in June 1985, Baker became an astronaut in July 1986 upon completion of a one-year training and evaluation program.\n\nFollowing the Challenger accident, from January 1986 to December 1987, Baker was assigned as a member of the team that was pursuing redesign, modification and improvements to the Shuttle Landing and Deceleration Systems, including nosewheel steering, brakes, tires, and drag chute, in an effort to provide greater safety margins during landing and rollout. He was then assigned to the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), where he was involved in the checkout and verification of the computer software and hardware interfaces for STS-26 (the return-to-flight mission) and subsequent flights.\n\nBaker then served as an ascent, entry and orbit spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-27, STS-29, STS-30, STS-28, STS-34, STS-33, STS-32, STS-36, STS-31, STS-38, and STS-35. In this capacity his duties included communication with the Shuttle crew during simulations and actual missions, as well as working procedural problems and modifications between missions. He served as the leader of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center for Shuttle Missions STS-44, STS-42 and STS-45. From December 1992 to January 1994 he was assigned as the Flight Crew Operations Directorate Representative to the Space Shuttle Program Office. From March to October 1995 he served as the Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. He was responsible for the coordination and implementation of mission operation activities in the Moscow region for the joint U.S./Russian Shuttle/Mir program.\n\nFrom October 1997 to August 2001 he was the Assistant Director of Johnson Space Center (JSC) for Human Space Flight Programs, Russia and was responsible for implementation and integration of NASA’s Human space flight programs in Russia. Those activities included International Space Station (ISS) training, operations, technical liaison, logistics and personnel administration support. He also served as the NASA JSC representative to the Russian Space Agency, Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City; Mission Control Center-Moscow, Energia Rocket and Spacecraft Corporation, Krunichev State Scientific and Production Space Center and other Russian government agencies and manufacturers involved in the ISS program. After his return to JSC in August 2001 he was assigned as the International Space Station Program Manager for International Operations responsible for the coordination of program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities with the International Partners.\n\nA veteran of four space flights, Baker has logged 965 hours in space. He served as pilot on STS-43 (August 2-11, 1991) and STS-52 (October 22 to November 1, 1992), and was the mission commander on STS-68 (September 30 to October 11, 1994) and STS-81 (January 12-22, 1997).\n[edit]\n\nCurrent assignment\n\nHe is currently assigned as the Assistant to the Chief of the Astronaut Office for International Partner Affairs responsible for the coordination of program operations, integration and flight crew training and support activities with the International Partners.\n[edit]\n\nSpace flight experience\n\nSTS-43 Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 2, 1991. During the flight, crew members deployed the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E), in addition to conducting 32 physical, material, and life science experiments, mostly relating to the Extended Duration Orbiter and Space Station Freedom. After 142 orbits of the Earth, the 9-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991. Mission duration was 213 hours, 21 minutes, 25 seconds.\n\nSTS-52 Space Shuttle Columbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 22, 1992. During the mission crew members deployed the Italian Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS) which will be used to measure movement of the Earth’s crust, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload 1 (USMP-1). Additionally, the Space Vision System (SVS) developed by the Canadian Space Agency was tested by the Canadian payload specialist and the crew using a small target assembly that was released from the remote manipulator system. The SVS will be used for Space Station construction. These three primary payloads together with numerous other payloads operated by the crew encompassed geophysics, materials science, biological research and applied research for Space Station Freedom. Following 159 orbits of the Earth, the 10-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 33 at the Kennedy Space Center on November 1, 1992. Mission duration was 236 hours, 56 minutes, 13 seconds.\n\nSTS-68 Space Shuttle Endeavour launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. This flight was the second flight of the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) comprised of a large radar called SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). As part of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL was an international, multidisciplinary study of global environmental change, both natural and man-made. The primary objective was to radar map the surface of the Earth to help us understand the contributions of ecology, hydrology, geology, and oceanography to changes in our Planet’s environment. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided in interpretation of the radar images. This SRL mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission concluded with a landing on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours, 46 minutes, 10 seconds.\n\nSTS-81 Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on January 12, 1997. STS-81 was the fifth in a series of joint missions between the U.S. Space Shuttle and the Russian Space Station Mir and the second one involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center’s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes.\n\nJANUARY 2003")

	(description "Mission highlights\n\nSpace Station assembly flight ISS-2A.2b will utilize the SPACEHAB Double Module and the Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC) to bring supplies to the station. The mission will also include 2 spacewalks.\n\nVeteran Astronaut Terry Wilcutt (Col., USMC) leads the seven-man crew, commanding his second Shuttle flight and making his fourth trip into space. During the planned 11-day mission, Wilcutt and his crew mates will spend a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double SPACEHAB cargo module in the rear of Atlantis's cargo bay and from a Russian Progress M-1 resupply craft docked to the aft end of the Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda, which linked up to the ISS on July 26, will serve as the early living quarters for the station and is the cornerstone of the Russian contribution to the ISS.\n\nThe goal of the flight is to prepare Zvezda for the arrival of the first resident, or Expedition, crew later this fall and the start of a permanent human presence on the new outpost. That crew, Expedition Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev, is due to launch in a Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in late October for a four-month \"shakedown\" mission aboard the ISS.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko (Col., Russian Air Force), both making their second flights into space, will conduct a 6½-hour space walk on the fourth day of the flight to hook up electrical, communications and telemetry cables between Zvezda and the Zarya Control Module, whose computers handed over commanding functions to the Service Module's computers in a smooth transition in late July. Lu and Malenchenko will also install a magnetometer to the exterior of Zvezda. The magnetometer will serve as a three-dimensional compass designed to minimize Zvezda propellent usage by relaying information to the module's computers regarding its orientation relative to the Earth.\n\nIt will be the second joint U.S.-Russian space walk outside a Space Shuttle, following on the work conducted by Astronaut Scott Parazynski and Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov outside Atlantis while docked to the Mir Space Station during the STS-86 mission in October 1997. Lu, designated EV 1, will wear the space suit marked by red stripes, while Malenchenko, EV 2, will wear the pure white suit. This will be Lu's first space walk, while Malenchenko conducted a pair of space walks totaling 12 hours during his four-month stay aboard Mir in 1994. Dan Burbank (Lt. Cmdr, USCG), who is a space rookie, will serve as the space walk choreographer.\n\nMission Specialist Rick Mastracchio, also a space novice, will be the prime robot arm operator for the mission, using the Canadian-built arm to move Lu and Malenchenko around the ISS as they conduct their assembly work. Mastracchio is backed up on arm operations by Pilot Scott Altman (Cmdr., USN), making his second flight into space.\n\nThe final member of the crew is Russian Cosmonaut Dr. Boris Morukov, making his first flight into space. Morukov will be responsible for unloading supplies from the Progress vehicle during the docked phase of the flight.\n\nWhen Wilcutt guides Atlantis in for its docking with the ISS on the third day of the mission, he will find the new station a much larger facility than the one left by the STS-101 crew during its flight in May. With the addition of the Zvezda and the Progress resupply ship, the ISS will be 143 feet (44 m) long, roughly the height of a 13 storey building, and will weigh 67 tons, twice the size of the ISS back in May. The joining of Zvezda to the ISS and the arrival of the Progress provides about 8,800 ft³ (250 m³) of habitable volume for Station crew members, roughly the size of a comfortable apartment. By the time the U.S. Laboratory Destiny is installed on the ISS in January, the Station will have surpassed both Skylab and Mir in total livable space.\n\nOn the fifth day of the flight, Atlantis's crew will enter the ISS, opening the hatch for the first time to Zvezda and to the Progress to begin unloading 1,300 pounds (590 kg) of goods from the Russian craft for the first resident crew, including items ranging from clothing to medical kits, personal hygiene kits, laptop computers, a color printer, vacuum cleaners, food warmers for Zvezda's galley, trash bags and critical life support hardware, including an Elektron oxygen generation unit and a Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit. Elektron and Vozdukh will be unstowed from the Progress and moved into Zvezda, but will not be installed and activated until the Expedition One crew arrives on board. The first toilet for the ISS will be delivered to Zvezda on the last day of the crew's work inside the Station for installation this fall once the Expedition 1 crew is on board.\n\nAmong the first tasks facing Atlantis's crew will be the installation of three batteries and associated electronic components in Zvezda and replacement of two of the six batteries in the Zarya module, completing the work begun by the STS-101 crew in May. Zvezda was launched from Baikonur on July 12 with five of its eight battery sets already installed. Lu and Malenchenko will be in charge of the installation work in Zvezda. Also earmarked for Zvezda is the activation of two gas masks which will serve as standard emergency equipment for ISS crews and three fire extinguishers. In addition, American-Russian power conversion units will be installed in Zvezda on this flight to route electricity from huge solar arrays which will be installed on the STS-97 mission to the Russian modules. Electrical components to charge the batteries of Soyuz or Progress vehicles visiting the ISS will be installed in Zvezda as well.\n\nWhile Morukov spends most of his time unloading supplies from the Progress, Mastracchio will be in charge of unloading 2 tons of equipment from the SPACEHAB module, including medical equipment for the ISS' Crew Health Care System, or CheCS, which will serve as the heart of the station's clinic for orbiting crews, and a treadmill device and bicycle ergometer which will serve as the first exercise gear for crews on board the ISS. Associated hardware for the treadmill which will prevent its use from disturbing sensitive microgravity experiments, will be installed by the crew members near the end of their stay on board.\n\nOn the tenth day of the flight, Atlantis will undock from the ISS and Altman will conduct a flyaround of the newly expanded station to enable his crew mates to conduct photo documentation of the outpost.\n\nTwo days later, Wilcutt will fly Atlantis to a predawn landing at the Kennedy Space Center. setting the stage a few days later for the launch of a second Russian Progress ship to the Station and a plethora of Shuttle assembly flights to turn the complex into a working research facility.")

Astronaut John Blaha, who has been on Mir since September 19, 1996, will be replaced by astronaut Jerry Linenger. Linenger will spend more than four months on Mir. He will return to Earth on Space Shuttle Mission STS-84, which was scheduled for launch in May 1997.\n\nAtlantis carried the SPACEHAB double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. During the five days of docked operations with Mir, the crews will transfer water and supplies from one spacecraft to the other. A spacewalk by Linenger and one of his Russian cosmonaut crewmates will be after Atlantis departs.\n\nThe STS-81 mission included several experiments in the fields of advanced technology, Earth sciences, fundamental biology, human life sciences, microgravity, and space sciences. It was hoped that data would supply insight for the planning and development of the International Space Station, Earth-based sciences of human and biological processes, and the advancement of commercial technology.\n\nSTS-81 will involve the transfer of 5,975 pounds (2,700 kg) of logistics to and from the Mir, the largest transfer of items to date. During the docked phase, 1,400 pounds (635 kg) of water, 1,137.7 pounds (516.1 kg) of U.S. science equipment, 2,206.1 pounds (1,000.7 kg) of Russian logistics along with 268.2 pounds (121.7 kg) of miscellaneous material will be transferred to Mir. Returning to Earth aboard Atlantis will be 1,256.6 pounds (570.0 kg) of U.S. science material, 891.8 pounds (404.5 kg) of Russian logistics and 214.6 pounds (97.3 kg) of miscellaneous material.\n\nFirst Shuttle flight of 1997 highlighted by return of U.S. astronaut John Blaha to Earth after 118-day stay aboard Russian Space Station Mir and the largest transfer to date of logistics between the two spacecraft. Atlantis also returned carrying the first plants to complete a life cycle in space — a crop of wheat grown from seed to seed. This fifth of nine planned dockings continued Phase 1B of the NASA/Russian Space Agency cooperative effort, with Linenger becoming the third U.S. astronaut in succession to live on Mir. Same payload configuration flown on previous docking flight — featuring SPACEHAB Double module — flown again.\n\nBlaha joined Mir 22 crew of Commander Valeri Korzun and Flight Engineer Alexandr Kaleri on September 19, 1996, when he arrived there with the crew of STS-79. Linenger was to work with the Mir 22 crew until the arrival in February of the Mir 23 crew of Commander Vasili Tsibliev, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin and German researcher Reinhold Ewald. Ewald was to return to Earth with the Mir 22 cosmonauts after a brief stay on the station. Astronaut Michael Foale will replace Linenger on Mir when the STS-84 mission arrives in May 1997.\n\nDocking occurred at 22:55 EST, January 14, followed by hatch opening at 00:57 January 15. Linenger officially traded places at 04:45 with Blaha who spent 118 days on the station and 128 days total on-orbit. During five days of mated operations, crews transferred nearly 6,000 pounds (2,722 kilograms) of logistics to Mir, including around 1,600 pounds (725 kg) of water; around 1,138 pounds (516 kg) of U.S. science equipment; and 2,206 pounds (1001 kg) of Russian logistical equipment. About 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) of materials returned with Atlantis from Mir.\n\nCrew also tested on Shuttle the Treadmill Vibration Isolation and Stabilization System (TVIS), designed for use in the Russian Service Module of the International Space Station. Another activity related to International Space Station involved firing the orbiter's small vernier jet thrusters during mated operations to gather engineering data.\n\nUndocking occurred at 09:15 EST, January 19, followed by flyaround of Mir.\n\nNo significant in-flight anomalies experienced with orbiter.")

The shuttle previously Mir missions were STS-71, STS-74, STS-76, STS-79 and STS-81. The U.S. astronauts will launch and land on a Shuttle and serve as Mir crew members while the Mir cosmonauts use their traditional Soyuz vehicle for launch and landing. This series of missions will expand U.S. research on Mir by providing resupply materials for experiments to be performed aboard the station as well as returning experiment samples and data to Earth.\n\nSTS-84 will involve the transfer of 7,314 pounds (3,318 kg) of water and logistics to and from the Mir. During the docked phase, 1,025 pounds (465 kg) of water, 844.9 pounds (383.2 kg) of U.S. science equipment, 2,576.4 pounds (1,168.6 kg) of Russian logistics along with 392.7 pounds (178.1 kg) of miscellaneous material will be transferred to Mir. Returning to Earth aboard Atlantis will be 897.4 pounds (407.1 kg) of U.S. science material, 1,171.2 pounds (531.2 kg) of Russian logistics, 30 pounds (14 kg) of ESA material and 376.4 pounds (170.7 kg) of miscellaneous material.\n\nSixth Shuttle-Mir docking highlighted by transfer of fourth successive U.S. crew member to the Russian Space Station. U.S. astronaut Mike Foale exchanged places with Jerry Linenger, who arrived at Mir January 15, 1997 with the crew of Shuttle Mission STS-81. Linenger spent 123 days on Mir and just over 132 days in space from launch to landing, placing him second behind U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid for most time spent on-orbit by an American. Another milestone reached during his stay was one-year anniversary of continuous U.S. presence in space that began with Lucid's arrival at Mir March 22, 1996.\n\nOther significant events during Linenger's stay included first U.S.-Russian space walk. On April 29, 1997 Linenger participated in five-hour extravehicular activity (EVA) with Mir 23 Commander Vasily Tsibliev to attach a monitor to the outside of the station. The Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) was to remain on Mir for nine months to allow study of the effect of the space environment on optical properties, such as mirrors used in telescopes.\n\nOn February 23, a fire broke out on the 11 year old station. It caused minimal damage but required station's inhabitants to wear protective masks for about 36 hours until cabin air was cleaned. Besides Linenger, crew members aboard Mir at the time included two Mir 22 cosmonauts and a German cosmonaut, and two Mir 23 cosmonauts.\n\nSTS-84 docking with Mir occurred May 16 at 10:33 p.m. EDT above the Adriatic Sea. Hatches between two spacecraft opened at 12:25 a.m., May 17. Greetings exchanged between STS-84 crew and Mir 23 Commander Vasili Tsibliev, Flight Engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin and Linenger, followed by a safety briefing. Linenger and Foale officially traded places at 10:15 a.m. EDT.\n\nTransfer of items to and from Mir proceeded smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule. One of first items transferred to station was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Altogether about 249 items were moved between the two spacecraft, and about 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of water moved to Mir, for a total of about 7,500 pounds (3,400 kg) of water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware.\n\nResearch program planned for Foale featured 35 investigations total (33 on Mir, two on STS-84, and another preflight/postflight) in six disciplines: advanced technology, Earth observations and remote sensing, fundamental biology, human life sciences, space station risk mitigation, and microgravity sciences. Twenty-eight of these were conducted during previous missions and were to be continued, repeated or completed during Foale's stay. Seven new experiments were planned in biological and crystal growth studies and materials processing.\n\nUndocking occurred at 9:04 p.m. EDT, May 21. Unlike prior dockings, no flyaround of the station by the orbiter was conducted, but orbiter was stopped three times while backing away to collect data from a European sensor device designed to assist future rendezvous of a proposed European Space Agency resupply vehicle with the International Space Station.\n\nOther activities conducted during the mission included investigations using the Biorack facility, located in the SPACEHAB Double Module in Atlantis' payload bay, a photo survey of Mir during docked operations, environmental air samplings and radiation monitoring.\n\nOrbiter performance was nominal from launch to landing.")

He enjoys scuba diving, racquetball, swimming, and sailing. His parents, Carl & Pat Wisoff, reside in Norfolk.\n\nEDUCATION: Graduated from Norfolk Academy, Norfolk, Virginia, in 1976; received a bachelor of science degree in physics (with Highest Distinction) from University of Virginia in 1980, a master of science degree and a doctorate in applied physics from Stanford University in 1982 and 1986 respectively.\n\nSPECIAL HONORS: NASA Space Flight Medals (1993, 1994, 1997); NCR Faculty Award of Excellence (1989); National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship 1980-1983; Physics Prize and Shannon Award from the University of Virginia (1980). Selected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1979.\n\nEXPERIENCE: After graduating from the University of Virginia in 1976, Dr. Wisoff began his graduate work on the development of short wavelength lasers at Stanford University as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow. Upon completing his master's and doctorate degrees at Stanford in 1986, Dr. Wisoff joined the faculty of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rice University. His research focused on the development of new vacuum ultraviolet and high intensity laser sources. In addition, he also collaborated with researchers from regional Texas Medical Centers on the applications of lasers to the reconstruction of damaged nerves. He has recently collaborated with researchers at Rice University on new techniques for growing and evaluating semiconductor materials using lasers. Dr. Wisoff has contributed numerous papers at technical conferences and in journals in the areas of lasers and laser applications.\n\nNASA EXPERIENCE: Selected by NASA in January 1990, Dr. Wisoff became an astronaut in July 1991. He is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. His technical assignments to date include: spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control; flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); coordinating flight crew equipment; evaluating extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment and techniques for the construction of Space Station; lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, STS-57 in 1993, STS-68 in 1994, STS-81 in 1997 and STS-92 in 2000, Dr. Wisoff has logged a total of 42 days, 56 hours, 1 minute and 48 seconds in space, including 19 hours and 53 minutes of EVA time in three space walks.\n\nSPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE: STS-57 Endeavour (June 21 to July 1, 1993) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The primary objective of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA) using the RMS. Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially-provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. During the mission Wisoff conducted a 5-hour, 50-minute spacewalk during which the EURECA communications antennas were manually positioned for latching, and various extravehicular activity tools and techniques were evaluated for use on future missions. STS-57 was accomplished in 155 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nSTS-68 Endeavour (September 30 to October 11, 1994) was the Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2) mission. As part of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour’s cargo bay to study Earth’s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth’s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth in 269 hours and 46 minutes, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.\n\nSTS-81 Atlantis (January 12-22, 1997) was a ten-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia’s Space Station Mir, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth in 244 hours, 55 minutes, the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center’s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey.\n\nSTS-92 Discovery (October 11-24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using Discovery’s robotic arm and performed four space walks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. Dr. Wisoff totaled 13 hours and 16 minutes of EVA time in two space walks. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds.\n\nOCTOBER 2000")

In completing his first mission, Linenger logged 10 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes in space, completed 177 orbits, and traveled over 4.5 million miles.\n\nFollowing his first mission, he began training at the Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, in preparation for a long-duration stay aboard the Russian Space Station Mir. All training was conducted using the Russian language, and consisted of learning all Mir space station systems (life support/electrical/communication/attitude control/computer systems), simulator training, Soyuz launch/return vehicle operations, and spacewalk water tank training. He also trained as chief scientist to conduct the entire US science program, consisting of over one-hundred planned experiments in various disciplines. A sampling includes: medicine (humoral immunity, sleep monitoring, radiation dosimetry), physiology (spatial orientation/performance changes during long duration flight), epidemiology (microbial surface sampling), metallurgy (determination of metal diffusion coefficients), oceanography/geology/limnology/physical science (photographic survey (over 10,000 photos) of the planet), space science (flame propagation), microgravity science (behavior of fluids, critical angle determination).\n\nLinenger launched aboard U.S. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-81) on January 12, 1997, remained onboard the space station with two Russian cosmonauts upon undocking of the Shuttle, and eventually returned upon a different mission of Atlantis (STS-84) on May 24, 1997-spending a total of 132 days, 4 hours, 1 minute in space-the longest duration flight of an American male at that time.\n\nDuring his stay aboard space station Mir, Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and in a non-American made spacesuit. During the five hour walk, he and his Russian colleague tested for the first time ever the newly designed Orlan-M Russian-built spacesuit, installed the Optical Properties Monitor (OPM) and Benton dosimeter on the outer surface of the station, and retrieved for analysis on Earth numerous externally-mounted material-exposure panels.\n\nThe three crewmembers also performed a \"flyaround\" in the Soyuz spacecraft-undocking from one docking port of the station, manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location-thus making Linenger the first American to undock from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (U.S. Space Shuttle and Russian Soyuz).\n\nWhile living aboard the space station, Linenger and his two Russian crewmembers faced numerous difficulties-the most severe fire ever aboard an orbiting spacecraft, failures of onboard systems (oxygen generator, carbon dioxide scrubbing, cooling line loop leaks, communication antenna tracking ability, urine collection and processing facility), a near collision with a resupply cargo ship during a manual docking system test, loss of station electrical power, and loss of attitude control resulting in a slow, uncontrolled \"tumble\" through space. In spite of these challenges and added demands on their time (in order to carry out the repair work), they still accomplished all mission goals-spacewalk, flyaround, and one-hundred percent of the planned U.S. science experiments.\n\nIn completing the nearly five month mission, Linenger logged approximately 50 million miles (the equivalent of over 110 roundtrips to the Moon and back), more than 2000 orbits around the Earth, and traveled at an average speed of 18,000 miles per hour.")

Launch scheduled for April 18, then April 12, then April 10, following Flight Readiness Review (FRR). First time date set at FRR was earlier than that shown on previous planning schedules. Launch April 10 scrubbed at T-4 minutes due to faulty valve in auxiliary power unit (APU) number one. APU replaced and payload batteries recharged. Countdown briefly halted at T-31 seconds when computer software failed to shut down a fuel valve line on ground support equipment. Engineers ordered valve to shut and countdown continued. Launch Weight: 249,109 lb (112,994 kg).\n\nSTS-31 was the tenth launch of the shuttle Discovery. On board were Loren Shriver, Charles Bolden, Bruce McCandless, Steven Hawley, and Kathryn Sullivan.\n\nThe primary payload was the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), deployed in a 380 statute mile (612 km) orbit. The shuttle's orbit in this mission was its second highest orbit up to that date, in order that the HST could be released near to its operational altitude well outside of the atmosphere. Discovery orbited the earth 80 times in this, its 10th mission.\n\nThe main purpose of this mission was to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) astronomical observatory. It was designed to operate above the earth's turbulent and obscuring atmosphere to observe celestial objects at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This was a joint NASA-ESA effort. The rest of the mission was devoted to photography and onboard experiments. To launch HST into an orbit that guaranteed longevity, Discovery soared to 600 km - the highest shuttle altitude to date. The record height permitted the crew to photograph earth's large scale geographic features not apparent from lower orbits. Motion pictures were recorded by two IMAX cameras. Experiment activity included a biomedical technology study, advanced materials research; particle contamination and ionizing radiation measurements; and student science project studying zero gravity effects on electronic arcs. Discovery's reentry from its higher than usual orbit call for a deorbit burn of 4 min 58 s, the longest in shuttle history.\n\nSecondary payloads: IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) to document operations outside crew cabin and hand-held IMAX camera for use inside crew cabin; Ascent Particle Monitor (APM) to detect particulate matter in payload bay; Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) to provide data on growing protein crystals in microgravity; Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME III) to measure gamma ray levels in crew cabin; Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) to determine porosity control in microgravity environment; Shuttle Student involvement program (SSIP) experiment to study effects of near-weightlessness on electrical arcs, and Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) experiment.\n\nApril 29, 1990, 6:49:57 a.m. PDT, Runway 22, Edwards Air Force Base, CA.

Its position outside the Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images, and since its launch in 1990, it has become one of the most important telescopes in the history of astronomy. It has been responsible for many ground-breaking observations and has helped astronomers achieve a better understanding of many fundamental problems in astrophysics.\n\nFrom its original conception in 1946 until its launch, the project to build a space telescope was beset by delays and budget problems. Immediately after its launch, it was found that the main mirror suffered from spherical aberration, severely compromising the telescope's capabilities. However, after a servicing mission in 1993, the telescope was restored to its planned quality and became a vital research tool as well as a public relations boon for astronomy.\n\nThe future of Hubble is currently uncertain. Though the United States Congress has appropriated funds to repair the telescope in July 2005, it is possible that a servicing mission may be cancelled again. Without intervention it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere some time after 2010. Its successor telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, is due to be launched in 2012.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Conception, design and aims\n          o 1.1 Proposals and precursors\n          o 1.2 The quest for funding\n          o 1.3 Construction and engineering\n          o 1.4 Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA)\n          o 1.5 Spacecraft systems\n          o 1.6 Ground support\n          o 1.7 Challenger disaster\n          o 1.8 Instruments\n    * 2 Flawed mirror\n          o 2.1 Origin of the problem\n          o 2.2 Design of a solution\n          o 2.3 COSTAR\n    * 3 Servicing missions and new instruments\n          o 3.1 Servicing mission 1\n          o 3.2 Subsequent servicing missions\n    * 4 Scientific results\n          o 4.1 Important discoveries\n          o 4.2 Impact on astronomy\n    * 5 Using the telescope\n          o 5.1 Observation scheduling\n          o 5.2 Amateur observations\n    * 6 Hubble data\n          o 6.1 Transmission to Earth\n          o 6.2 Archive\n          o 6.3 Pipeline reduction\n          o 6.4 Data analysis\n    * 7 Outreach activities\n    * 8 The future\n          o 8.1 Equipment failure\n          o 8.2 Orbital decay\n          o 8.3 Debate over final servicing mission\n          o 8.4 Solutions\n    * 9 References\n    * 10 External links\n\n[edit]\n\nConception, design and aims\n[edit]\n\nProposals and precursors\nLyman Spitzer, 'father' of the Space Telescope\nEnlarge\nLyman Spitzer, 'father' of the Space Telescope\n\nThe history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, when astronomer Lyman Spitzer wrote a paper entitled Astronomical advantages of an extra-terrestrial observatory. In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes: First, the angular resolution (smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by diffraction, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere which causes stars to twinkle and is known to astronomers as seeing. Ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0 arcseconds, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.1 arcsec for a telescope with a mirror 2.5 m in diameter. The second major advantage would be that a space-based telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light, which are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nSpitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for a space telescope to be developed. In 1962 a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965, Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining the scientific objectives for a large space telescope.\n\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following World War II, as scientists made use of the developments in rocket technology that had taken place. The first ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun was obtained in 1946. An orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the UK as part of the Ariel space program, and 1966 saw NASA's launch of the first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission, but OAO-2 carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.\n\nThe OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and 1968 saw the development by NASA of firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3 m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope, with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasised the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable Space Shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available [1].\n[edit]\n\nThe quest for funding\n\nThe continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST (Large Space Telescope, the original name) should be a major goal. In 1970 NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the science goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The US Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts instigated by Gerald Ford led to Congress cutting all funding for the telescope project.\n\nIn response to this, a nationwide lobbying effort was co-ordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met congressmen and senators in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organised. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasising the need for a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to a budget half that originally refused by Congress.\n\nThe funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2.4 m, both to cut costs and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor 1.5m space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the European Space Agency. ESA agreed to supply some of the instruments for the telescope as well as the solar cells which would power it and contribute approximately 15% of the costs, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of observing time on the telescope. Congress eventually approved funding of US$36,000,000 for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983. During the early 1980s, the telescope was named after Edwin Hubble, who made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he discovered that the universe was expanding.\n[edit]\n\nConstruction and engineering\nPolishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979\nEnlarge\nPolishing of Hubble's primary mirror begins at Perkin-Elmer corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, May 1979\n\nOnce the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided between many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center was given responsibility for the design, development and construction of the telescope, while the Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground control centre for the mission. Marshall commissioned optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. Lockheed were commissioned to construct the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed. [2]\n[edit]\n\nOptical Telescope Assembly (OTA)\n\nThe mirror and optical systems of the telescope were the most crucial part, and were designed to exacting specifications. Telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but because the Space Telescope was to be used for observations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared with ten times better resolution than the best previous telescopes, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 1/20 of the wavelength of visible light, or about 30 nanometres.\n\nPerkin-Elmer intended to use extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape, but in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, Kodak were commissioned to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. Construction of the mirror began in 1979, using ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of inch-thick top and bottom plates sandwiching a honeycomb lattice.\n\nMirror polishing began in 1979 and continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed by the end of 1981 with the addition of a reflective coating of aluminum 75 nm thick and a protective coating of magnesium fluoride 25 nm thick, which increased the mirror's reflectivity in ultraviolet light.\n\nHowever, doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate. In response to a schedule described as \"unsettled and changing daily,\" NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985. Perkin-Elmer's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter, and at times delays reached one day for each day of work. NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until first March and then September 1986. By this time the total project budget had risen to $1.175 billion [3].\n[edit]\n\nSpacecraft systems\nEarly stages of Hubble's construction, 1980\nEnlarge\nEarly stages of Hubble's construction, 1980\n\nThe spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to adequately withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth's shadow which would generate major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow the extremely accurate pointing of the telescope that would be required. A shroud of multi-layered insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable, and surrounds a light aluminium shell in which the telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned.\n\nWhile construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction [4].\n[edit]\n\nGround support\n\nIn 1983, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) was established after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) and is physically located on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, which is one of the 32 U.S. universities and 7 international affiliates that comprise the AURA consortium.\n\nSTScI is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to astronomers, a function which NASA had wanted to keep 'in-house', but which scientists were keen to see based in an academic establishment. Engineering support is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, 30 miles south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble's Flight Operations Team.\n\nThe Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility was established at Garching bei München near Munich in 1984 to provide similar support primarily for European astronomers.\n[edit]\n\nChallenger disaster\n\nIn early 1986, the planned launch date of October that year looked feasible, but the Challenger disaster brought the US space program to a halt, grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of Hubble to be postponed for several years. All telescope parts had to be kept in clean rooms until a launch could be rescheduled, a costly situation which pushed the overall costs of the project still higher.\n\nEventually, following the resumption of Shuttle flights in 1988, the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990. In preparation for its final launch, dust which had accumulated on the mirror since its completion had to be removed with jets of nitrogen, and all systems were tested extensively to ensure they were fully functional. Finally, on 24 April 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Atlantis launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit.\n\nFrom its original total cost estimate of 435 million dollars (in FY77 funds), the telescope had by now cost over US$2.5 billion to construct. Hubble's cumulative costs to-date are approximately 14 billion dollars (inflation adjusted to the buying power of FY2005).\n[edit]\n\nInstruments\nShuttle mission STS-31 lifts off, carrying Hubble into orbit.\nEnlarge\nShuttle mission STS-31 lifts off, carrying Hubble into orbit.\n\nWhen launched, the HST carried five scientific instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC was a high-resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations. It was built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained four CCD chips, three of which were 'wide field' chips while the fourth was the 'planetary camera' (PC). The PC took images at a longer effective focal length than the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification.\n\nThe GHRS was a spectrograph designed to operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center in conjunction with Ball Aerospace, and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90,000 [5]. Also optimised for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, both of which were also capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instrument on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. FOC was constructed by ESA, while the Martin Marietta corporation built the FOS.\n\nThe final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at the University of Wisconsin. It was optimised for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2% or better [6].\n[edit]\n\nFlawed mirror\n\nWithin weeks of the launch of the telescope, the images returned showed that there was a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than ground-based images, the telescope failed to achieve a final sharp focus, and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a point spread function concentrated within a circle 0.1 arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria [7].\n\nAnalysis of the flawed images showed that the cause of the problem must be that the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most accurately figured mirror ever made, with variations from the prescribed curve of no more than 1/20 of the wavelength of light, it was too flat at the edges. The mirror was barely 2 micrometres out from the required shape, but the difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edges of a mirror reaches a different focus to the light reflecting off the centre. The aberration meant that images from the Space Telescope were only marginally better than the best images obtainable from the ground.\n[edit]\n\nOrigin of the problem\nAn extract from a WF/PC shows the light from a star spread over a wide area instead of being concentrated on a few pixels.\nEnlarge\nAn extract from a WF/PC shows the light from a star spread over a wide area instead of being concentrated on a few pixels.\n\nWorking backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror was −1.0139, instead of the intended −1.00229. The same number was also derived by analysing the null correctors (instruments which accurately measure the curvature of a polished surface) used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, as well as by analysing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror.\n\nA commission was established to determine how the error could have arisen and was headed by Lew Allen, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Allen Commission found that the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer had been incorrectly calibrated, as a spot on a metering scale where an end cap had worn away was wrongly believed to be a valid scale. The null corrector had then been wrongly spaced by 1.3 mm.\n\nDuring the polishing of the mirror, Perkin-Elmer had analysed its surface with two other null correctors, both of which (correctly) indicated that the mirror was suffering from spherical aberration. These tests were specifically designed to eliminate the possibility of major optical aberrations. Against written quality guidelines the company ignored these test results as it believed that the two null correctors were less accurate than the primary device which was reporting that the mirror was perfectly figured.\n\nThe commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer had not regarded the telescope mirror as a crucial part of their business and were also secure in the knowledge that NASA could not take its business elsewhere once the polishing had begun. While the commission heavily criticised Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticised for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument. [8]\n[edit]\n\nDesign of a solution\n\nThe flaw meant that Hubble could obtain data about as good as that achievable with a large ground-based telescope on a night of good seeing, but at a vastly greater cost. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. However, the design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem which could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993.\n\nWhile Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, or bring the telescope temporarily back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as 'spectacles' to correct the spherical aberration.\n\nBecause of the way the instruments were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) included four relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge-coupled device (CCD) chips making up the camera, and so the relay mirrors on the replacement Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 could be figured to correct the aberration. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces which could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.\n[edit]\n\nCOSTAR\n\nThe system designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focussed at the FOC, FOS and GHRS was called the \"Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement\" (COSTAR) and consisted essentially of two mirrors in the light path, one of which would be figured to correct the aberration [9]. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, one of the other instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed.\n\nDuring the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections could be fitted, the telescope still carried out a large number of observations. Spectroscopic observations in particular were not too badly affected by the aberration, but many imaging projects were cancelled as the space telescope no longer gave decisive advantages over ground-based observations. Despite the setbacks, the first three years saw numerous scientific advances as astronomers worked to optimise the results obtained using sophisticated image processing techniques.\n[edit]\n\nServicing missions and new instruments\nAstronauts work on Hubble during the first servicing mission.\nEnlarge\nAstronauts work on Hubble during the first servicing mission.\n[edit]\n\nServicing mission 1\n\nThe telescope had always been designed so that it could be regularly serviced, but after the problems with the mirror came to light, the first servicing mission assumed a much greater importance, as the astronauts would have to carry out extensive work on the telescope to install the corrective optics. The seven astronauts selected for the mission were trained intensively in the use of the hundred or so specialised tools which would need to be used. The mission (STS-61) took place in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over a total of 10 days.\n\nMost importantly, the High Speed Photometer was replaced with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC was replaced with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), with its internal optical correction system. In addition, the solar arrays and their drive electronics were replaced, as well as four of the gyroscopes used in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded, and finally, the telescope's orbit was boosted, having been slowly decaying for three years due to drag in the tenuous upper atmosphere.\nImprovement in Hubble images after the first service mission.\nEnlarge\nImprovement in Hubble images after the first service mission.\n\nOn January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first of many much sharper images [10]. The mission had been one of the most complex ever undertaken, involving five lengthy periods of extravehicular activity, and its resounding success was an enormous boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a fully capable space telescope.\n[edit]\n\nSubsequent servicing missions\n\nSubsequent servicing missions were less dramatic, but each gave the space telescope new capabilities. Servicing Mission 2 (STS-82) in February 1997 replaced the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder, repaired thermal insulation and again boosted Hubble's orbit. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the infrared 'noise' from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.\n\nServicing Mission 3A (STS-103) took place in December 1999, replaced all six gyroscopes (one had failed and rendered the telescope unusable just weeks before the mission), replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer was based on a space-qualified Intel 486 and permits some computing tasks that were previously performed by computers on the ground to be handled on board the spacecraft.\n\nServicing Mission 3B (STS-109) in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC being replaced with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), and also saw the revival of NICMOS, which had run out of coolant in 1999. A new cooling system was installed which reduced the instrument's temperature enough for it to be usable again, although it was not as cold as its original design called for.\n\nThe mission replaced the solar arrays for a third time, with the new arrays being smaller but generating more power. The new arrays were derived from those built for the Iridium comsat system and were only two-thirds the size of the old arrays, resulting in less drag against the tenuous reaches of the upper atmosphere, while providing 30% more power. The additional power allowed all instruments on board the Hubble to be run simultaneously, and reduced a vibration problem that occurred when the old, less rigid arrays entered and left direct sunlight. Hubble's Power Distribution Unit was also replaced in order to correct a problem with sticky relays, a procedure that required the complete electrical power down of the spacecraft for the first time since it was launched.\n\nThe completion of this servicing mission considerably enhanced Hubble's capabilities. The two instruments primarily affected by the mission, ACS and NICMOS, together imaged the Hubble Ultra Deep Field in 2003 to 2004.\n[edit]\n\nScientific results\n[edit]\n\nImportant discoveries\nOne of Hubble's most famous images: pillars of creation where stars are forming in the Eagle Nebula\nEnlarge\nOne of Hubble's most famous images: pillars of creation where stars are forming in the Eagle Nebula\n\nHubble has helped to resolve some long-standing problems in astronomy, as well as turning up results that have required whole new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain the value of the Hubble constant, the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of Hubble, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of 10%, which is consistent with other accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.\n\nWhile Hubble helped to refine the age of the universe, it also threw doubt on its future. Astronomers using the telescope to observe distant supernovae uncovered evidence that far from decelerating under the influence of gravity, the universe may in fact be accelerating. This acceleration was later confirmed by other ground-based and space-based telescopes, but the cause of this acceleration is currently very poorly understood.\n\nThe collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was very fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.\n\nOther major discoveries made using Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula; evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around sun-like stars; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious gamma-ray bursts.\n[edit]\n\nImpact on astronomy\n\nMany objective measures show the enormous impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 4,000 papers based on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year which receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data [11].\n\nAlthough the HST has clearly had a significant impact on astronomical research, the financial cost of this impact has been very large. A study on the relative impacts on astronomy of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m ground-based telescope such as the William Herschel Telescope, the HST cost about 100 times as much to build and maintain [12]. The development of adaptive optics in recent years means that ground-based telescopes can take images approaching the sharpness of Hubble images, at much lower cost, and this has been a key consideration in the debate about the future of space telescopes (see below).\n[edit]\n\nUsing the telescope\n\nAnyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation. Competition for time on the telescope is extremely intense, and the ratio of time requested to time available (the oversubscription ratio) typically ranges between 6 and 9. [13]\n\nCalls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a 'cycle' lasting approximately one year. Proposals are divided into several categories; 'general observer' proposals are the most common, covering routine observations. 'Snapshot observations' are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including the overheads of acquiring the target and so on; snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule which cannot be filled by regular GO programs.\n\nAstronomers may make 'Target of Opportunity' proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated Director's Discretionary (DD) Time. Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae. Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to the production of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations carried out by amateur astronomers (discussed below).\n[edit]\n\nObservation scheduling\nHubble's low orbit means many targets spend much of each orbit behind the Earth.\nEnlarge\nHubble's low orbit means many targets spend much of each orbit behind the Earth.\n\nScheduling observations for Hubble is not a simple matter. It is situated in a low-Earth orbit so that it can be reached by the Space Shuttle for servicing missions, but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels, and there is a also a sizable exclusion zone around the Sun, Moon and Earth which cannot be observed. However, there is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90 degrees to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not occulted for long periods. Due to the precession of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because the limb of the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations.\n\nBecause Hubble orbits in the upper atmosphere, its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable. The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means that Hubble's predicted position for six week's time could be in error by up to 4,000 km. Observation schedules are typically finalised only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed [14].\n[edit]\n\nAmateur observations\n\nThe first director of the STScI, Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his DD time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle, but excited great interest among amateur astronomers.\n\nProposals for amateur time were stringently peer reviewed by a committee of leading amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals with genuine scientific merit which did not duplicate proposals made by professionals and which required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. In total, 13 amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997. After that time, however, budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable, and no further amateur programs have been carried out [15].\n[edit]\n\nHubble data\n[edit]\n\nTransmission to Earth\n\nHubble data is initially stored on the spacecraft. When launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reel tape recorders, but these were replaced by solid state data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3A. From the onboard storage facilities, data is transferred to the ground via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, a system of satellites designed so that satellites in low-Earth orbit can communicate with their mission control facilities during about 85% of their orbit. Data is transmitted to the TDRSS ground station and then on to the Goddard Space Flight Center for archiving.\n[edit]\n\nArchive\n\nAll Hubble data is eventually made available via a public archive at http://archive.stsci.edu/hst. Data are usually proprietary—available only to the Principal Investigator and astronomers designated by the PI—for one year after being taken. The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances.\n\nObservations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive are in the FITS format, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use. The Hubble Heritage Project processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in JPEG and TIFF formats.\n[edit]\n\nPipeline reduction\n\nAstronomical data taken with CCDs must undergo several calibration steps before it is suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software which automatically calibrates data when it is requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories.\n\nAstronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.\n[edit]\n\nData analysis\n\nHubble data can be analysed using many different packages, but STScI develops the custom-made STSDAS (Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System) software. The software contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of IRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program, which runs only under various flavours of Linux and Mac OS X.\n[edit]\n\nOutreach activities\nThe Horsehead Nebula, selected by the public to be observed by Hubble for its 11th anniversary\nEnlarge\nThe Horsehead Nebula, selected by the public to be observed by Hubble for its 11th anniversary\n\nIt has always been important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.\n\nSeveral initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities. The Hubble Heritage Project was established to produce high-quality images for public consumption of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage Team is composed of amateur as well as professional astronomers as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy and emphasises the artistic nature of Hubble images.\n\nIn addition, STScI maintains several comprehensive websites for the general public containing Hubble images and information about the observatory. The outreach efforts are coordinated by the Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that US taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program.\n\nThe Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full colour image. In 2001, to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the launch of Hubble, NASA polled internet users to find out what they would most like Hubble to observe, and they overwhelmingly selected the Horsehead Nebula [16]. A Heritage Project image of the nebula was released on 24 April 2001, the 11th anniversary of the launch.\n[edit]\n\nThe future\n[edit]\n\nEquipment failure\nA WFPC2 image of a small region of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud\nEnlarge\nA WFPC2 image of a small region of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nPast servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible new types of science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. On August 3, 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001. It seems unlikely that any science functionality can be salvaged without a servicing mission.\n\nHubble uses gyroscopes to stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Normally, three gyroscopes are required for operation; observations are still possible with two gyros, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing would be more difficult. In 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made on August 31, 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use and two on backup. Estimates of the failure rate of the gyros indicate that Hubble may be down to one gyro by 2008, after which the telescope would be rendered unusable. [17]\n\nIn addition to predicted gyroscope failure, Hubble will eventually require a change of batteries. A robotic servicing mission including this would be tricky, as it requires many operations, and a failure in any might result in irreparable damage to Hubble. However, the observatory was designed so that during Shuttle servicing missions it would receive power from a connection to the Space Shuttle, and this fact may be utilized by adding an external power source (an additional battery) rather than changing the internal ones [18].\n[edit]\n\nOrbital decay\n\nHubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upper atmosphere, and over time its orbit decays due to drag. If it is not re-boosted by a shuttle or other means, it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere sometime between 2010 and 2032, with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere. The state of Hubble's gyros also impacts the re-entry date, as a controllable telescope can be made to minimize atmospheric drag. Not all of the telescope would burn up on re-entry. Parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive, leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities (estimated at up to a 1 in 700 chance of human fatality for a completely uncontrolled re-entry).\n\nAddition of an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry is currently being investigated by NASA. It would not have to be executed until the expected natural re-entry date, after Hubble has completed its operational lifetime. One potential model involves a Pac-Man shaped unit entirely enclosing the satellite. Alternatively, instead of being used to control re-entry, the propulsion module could boost the telescope into a much higher orbit, in which it could remain indefinitely.\n\nAnother possibility for safely de-orbiting Hubble is retrieval by a space shuttle. The Hubble telescope would then most likely be displayed in the Smithsonian Institution. The problems with this method are the cost of a shuttle flight (about $500 million by some estimates) and risk to a shuttle's crew. In the wake of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, NASA's astronaut office is wary of risking a shuttle crew simply to retrieve a museum-bound telescope [19]. Also, this mission would require a rebuild of the cargo space of the space shuttle sent to retrieve Hubble, since the only space shuttle unmodified since Hubble's launch (and therefore able to hold it in its cargo space) was the destroyed Columbia shuttle.\n[edit]\n\nDebate over final servicing mission\n\nThe Space Shuttle was originally scheduled to visit Hubble again in February 2005. The tasks of this servicing mission would include adding fresh gyroscopes and replacing the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 with a new Wide Field Camera 3. However, then-NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that, in order to prevent a repeat of the Columbia disaster, all future shuttles must be inspected externally on orbit before re-entry, a task which cannot be done without the facilities of the International Space Station (ISS). The shuttle is incapable of reaching both HST and ISS during the same mission, and so future manned service missions were cancelled.\n\nThis decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that the Hubble telescope was valuable enough to merit the risk. In particular, Hubble is one of the few telescopes currently operating which can image in the ultraviolet and near-infrared, and its successor telescope will not be launched until possibly several years after Hubble's demise. This break in space observing capabilities is of major concern to astronomers, given the great impact of Hubble observations on scientific output. On 29 January 2004, Sean O'Keefe said that that he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission of the Hubble Space Telescope due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nOn 13 July 2004, an official panel from the National Academy of Sciences made the recommendation that the Hubble telescope be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged \"NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope\". On August 11, 2004, Sean O'Keefe requested the Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. It is expected that the proposal will take 12 months to produce—any such mission, likely to cost in excess of $1 billion, will not take place before 2007.\n\nThe arrival, in April 2005, of the new NASA Administrator, Mike Griffin, has changed the status of both of the manned and unmanned rescue missions. Griffin has stated that he will reconsider the possibility of a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment, he authorized NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center to proceed with preparing for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision on this flight after the next two shuttle missions. At the same time, Griffin decided to cancel the plans for a robotic rescue mission, calling it \"not feasible.\" [20]\n[edit]\n\nSolutions\n\nNASA and the ESA are currently investigating building a follow on to the Hubble Space Telescope called the Hubble Origins Probe http://www.pha.jhu.edu/hop/. If approved, it would not be ready for launch until 2010. The probe would very likely use an Atlas V rocket for its ride to orbit. It would also incorporate new technology into its design to reduce its weight in respect to the original. The mission would be a one time five year run and would receive no servicing from the Space Shuttle. The mission is still being debated and is still absent of any funding. It may never be built.\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n    * ^  Benn C.R., Sánchez S.F.

	(description "STS-114 was the \"Return to Flight\" Space Shuttle mission which launched Space Shuttle Discovery at 10:39 EDT (14:39 UTC), July 26, 2005. The launch, 907 days after the loss of Columbia, was approved despite unresolved fuel sensor anomalies in the external tank; those anomalies had prevented the shuttle from launching on July 13, its originally scheduled date.\n\nThe mission was completed on August 9, 2005. Due to the poor weather at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, the shuttle landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, a secondary landing site.\n\nThe problem that resulted in the destruction of Columbia — debris separating from the external tank during ascent — unexpectedly recurred during the launch of Discovery. As a result, NASA decided on July 27 to postpone future shuttle flights pending additional modifications to the flight hardware.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Crew\n    * 2 Mission parameters\n    * 3 Mission highlights\n    * 4 Mission timeline\n          o 4.1 July 13, 2005\n          o 4.2 July 14, 2005\n          o 4.3 July 26, 2005\n          o 4.4 July 28, 2005\n          o 4.5 July 30, 2005\n          o 4.6 August 1, 2005\n          o 4.7 August 3, 2005\n          o 4.8 August 6, 2005\n          o 4.9 August 8, 2005\n          o 4.10 August 9, 2005\n    * 5 Wake-Up-Calls\n    * 6 In-flight repair\n    * 7 Contingency planning\n    * 8 Launch sequence anomalies\n    * 9 Related articles\n    * 10 Media\n    * 11 External links and sources\n\n[edit]\n\nCrew\n\n    * Eileen M.

The STS-114 mission was initially to be flown aboard the orbiter Atlantis, but NASA replaced it with Discovery after improperly installed gears were found in Atlantis' braking system. Seventeen years prior, Discovery had flown NASA's previous Return to Flight mission, STS-26.\nSpace Shuttle Discovery rose from the pad at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 10:39 a.m., July 26, 2005.\nEnlarge\nSpace Shuttle Discovery rose from the pad at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, 10:39 a.m., July 26, 2005.\n\nThe STS-114 mission delivered supplies to the International Space Station. However, the major focus of the mission was testing and evaluating new Space Shuttle flight safety techniques, which included new inspection and repair techniques. The crewmembers used the new Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS) — a set of instruments on a 50-foot (15 m) extension attached to the Remote Manipulator System. The OBSS instrument package consists of visual imaging equipment and a Laser Dynamic Range Imager (LDRI) to detect problems with the shuttle's Thermal Protection System. The crew scanned the leading edges of the wings, the nose cap, and the crew compartment for damage, as well as other potential problem areas engineers wished to inspect based on video taken during lift-off.\n\nSTS-114 was classified as Logistics Flight 1. Besides delivering supplies, the Shuttle replaced one of the ISS's Control Moment Gyroscopes. STS-114 also carried the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, built by the Italian Space Agency, and the External Stowage Platform-2.\n\nThe crew conducted three spacewalks while at the station. The first demonstrated repair techniques on the Shuttle's Thermal Protection System. During the second, the spacewalkers replaced the failed gyroscope. On the third, they installed the External Stowage Platform and repaired the shuttle, the first time repairs had been carried out during a spacewalk on the exterior of a spacecraft in flight. On August 1, it was announced protruding gap fillers on the front underside of the shuttle would be inspected and dealt with during the third spacewalk of the mission. The space walk was conducted on the morning of August 3. Robinson easily removed the two fillers with his fingers. Later on the same day, NASA officials said that they were looking closely at a thermal blanket located next to the commander's window on the port side of the orbiter. Published reports on August 4 said wind tunnel testing demonstrated that the orbiter is safe to re-enter with the billowed blanket.\n\nOn July 30, NASA announced that STS-114 would be extended for one day, so that Discovery's crew could help the ISS crew maintain the station while the shuttle fleet is grounded. The extra day was also used to move more items from the shuttle to the ISS, as uncertainty mounted during the mission as to when a shuttle will next visit the station. The orbiter's arrival also gave the nearly 200-ton space station a free altitude boost of about 4,000 feet (1,220 meters). The station loses about 100 feet (30 meters) of altitude a day. [1]\n\nThe shuttle hatch was closed the night before it undocked from the ISS. After undocking, the shuttle flew around the station to take photos.\n\nAtmospheric reentry and landing was originally planned for August 8, 2005, at Cape Canaveral, but unsuitable weather postponed the landing until the next day, then moved it to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where Discovery touched down at 8:11 AM EDT (5:11 AM PDT, 1211 UTC).\n[edit]\n\nMission timeline\n\nThis timeline is a summary.

According to NASA, the gap fillers, which each serve different purposes, are not required for reentry. One filler prevents \"chattering\" of tiles during ascent, which would occur due to the sonic booms from the noses of the solid rocket boosters and the external fuel tank. The other, in a different location where there is a wider gap between tiles, simply functions to reduce the gap size between tiles, which in turn reduces heat transfer to the shuttle. Even without this filler NASA did not expect the increased heat to cause a problem during reentry (it is present to avoid a level of heating which would only be problematic if experienced many times over a vehicle's design life). Since the gap fillers are not necessary for re-entry, it was acceptable to simply pull them out. An overview of the situation, including procedures for dealing with the protrusions were sent electronically to the crew and printed aboard the shuttle. The crew were also able to watch uploaded videos of NASA personnel on the ground demonstrating the repair techniques. Both the videos and 12 page procedure document [2] were also made available publicly via NASA's website.\n\nDuring the third EVA both the fillers were successfully removed with less than a pound of force without the need to use any tools. Stephen K. Robinson gave a running commentary of his work: \"I'm grasping it and I'm pulling it and it's coming out very easily\" ... \"It looks like this big patient is cured\".\n\nIf it were not possible to pull the fillers out then the protruding sections could have been simply cut off. The gap fillers are made of a cloth impregnated with ceramic - they are stiff and can be easily cut with a tool similar to a hacksaw blade. Protruding gap fillers are a problem because they disrupt the normally laminar air flow under the orbiter during reentry, which causes turbulence at lower speeds. A turbulent air flow results in a mixing of hot and cold air which can have a major effect on the shuttle temperature.\n\nThe decision to make the repair balanced the risks of the EVA with the risks of leaving the protruding gap fillers as they were. It is thought that gap filler protrusions of a similar magnitude were present on previous missions, but they were not observed in-orbit. Consideration was also given to the risks of elements of the procedure which would involve the ISS arm being used to carry Stephen K. Robinson below the shuttle, possibly the use of a sharp tool which has potential to damage the EVA suit or shuttle tiles. The possibility of making things worse by attempting a repair was given serious consideration. Cameras on the shuttle arm and on Robinson's helmet were used to monitor the activities under the shuttle.\n\nProtruding gap fillers had been identified as an issue on previous flights, notably STS-28. A post-flight analysis [3] identified that gap filler was the likely cause of the high temperatures observed during this re-entry. Protruding gap fillers were also seen on STS-73.\nDamaged thermal blanket\nEnlarge\nDamaged thermal blanket\n\nA further in-flight repair was considered to remove or clip a damaged thermal blanket located beneath the commander's window on the port side of the orbiter. Wind tunnel testing by NASA determined that the thermal blanket was safe for re-entry, and plans for a fourth spacewalk were cancelled.\n[edit]\n\nContingency planning\n\nSince the loss of Columbia in STS-107, it had been suggested that on future shuttle missions there would be a planned rescue capability involving having a second shuttle ready to fly at short notice. Even prior to the sensor problem causing the delay in the launch, a rescue option (called STS-300 by NASA) had been planned, which involved the crew of STS-114 remaining docked at the International Space Station until Atlantis could be launched with a four-person crew to retrieve the astronauts. Discovery would then be ditched by remote control over the Pacific Ocean, with Atlantis bringing back both its own crew, as well as that of Discovery.\n\nA further option for rescue would be to use Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Nikolay Sevastyanov, director of the Russian Space Corporation Energia, was reported by Pravda as saying: \"If necessary, we will be able to bring home nine astronauts on board three Soyuz spacecraft in January and February of the next year\". [4]\n[edit]\n\nLaunch sequence anomalies\nVideo of foam flying off shuttle's fuel tank\nVideo of foam flying off shuttle's fuel tank\n\nA large bird was struck around 2.5 seconds after lift-off. The bird impacted near the very top of the external fuel tank, and appeared to slide down the tank in subsequent frames of the video. NASA did not expect any adverse affects from this impact, because of the relatively low speed of the spacecraft when it occurred, and because it did not impact the orbiter.\n\nA small fragment of thermal tile, estimated to be around 1.5 inches (38 mm) in size, was ejected from an edge tile of the front landing gear door at some point prior to SRB separation. A small white area appeared on the tile as the piece detached, and the loose shard could be seen in a single frame of the video. It is unknown what object (if any) impacted the tile to cause the damage. The damaged tile was inspected further when the images from the umbilical camera were downloaded on day three. Engineers requested that this area be inspected by the OBSS, and flight managers scheduled the operation for July 29. This represented the only known possible damage to Discovery that could have posed a risk during re-entry.\nHandheld still image taken by Discovery's crew of the external fuel tank as it was jettisoned after launch. In this still image, the area of missing foam on the tank is indicated by a light spot near the upper edge of the tank just below the liquid oxygen feedline.\nEnlarge\nHandheld still image taken by Discovery's crew of the external fuel tank as it was jettisoned after launch. In this still image, the area of missing foam on the tank is indicated by a light spot near the upper edge of the tank just below the liquid oxygen feedline.\n\nSome seconds after SRB separation, a large piece of debris separated from the Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramp, which is part of the external tank (see animation, above right). The debris was thought to have measured 24 to 33 inches (610 to 838 mm) long, 10 to 14 inches (250 to 356 mm) wide, and a few inches thick – and to weigh about half as much as the piece of foam blamed for the loss of Columbia. Fortunately, it did not strike any part of the Discovery orbiter. Images of the external tank taken after separation from the orbiter show multiple areas where foam insulation was missing.\n\nAround 20 seconds later, a smaller piece of foam separated from the ET and apparently struck the orbiter's right wing. Based on the mass of the foam, and the velocity at which it would have struck the wing, NASA estimated it only exerted one-tenth the energy required to cause potential damage. Laser scanning and imaging of the wing by the OBSS did not reveal any damage.\n\nOn July 27, NASA announced that it was postponing all Shuttle flights until the foam loss problem is resolved.\n\nOn August 5, USA Today reported that[5] NASA was looking into extensive handling as a possible explanation for the loss of foam on the external tank. NASA Administrator Michael Griffin stated that the earliest the next shuttle could launch is 22 September, but that's only \"if next week, the guys have a eureka moment on the foam and spot why this big chunk came off.\" Later in August, it became clear that a September launch date would not be possible, and that the earliest date for the next launch would be in March 2006. With the destruction suffered by Lockheed's Michoud Assembly Facility and NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi due to Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flooding, it now appears the next shuttle launch will not be until sometime during the fall of 2006.")

After initial training as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator (B/N), he reported to Attack Squadron 34 in January 1981, and deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the USS John F. Kennedy, and to the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans aboard the USS America. He attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in January 1984. Upon graduation in December he worked as a project test flight officer flying the A-6 Intruder until August 1984, when he returned to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School as a flight instructor. In April 1987, Bursch was assigned to the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1, as Strike Operations Officer, making deployments to the Indian Ocean aboard the USS Long Beach and the USS Midway. Redesignated an Aeronautical Engineering Duty officer (AEDO), he attended the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, from July 1989 until his selection to the astronaut program.\n\nHe has over 2,900 flight hours in more than 35 different aircraft.\n[edit]\n\nNASA experience\n\nSelected by NASA in January 1990, Bursch became an astronaut in July 1991. His technical assignments to date include: Astronaut Office Operations Development Branch, working on controls and displays for the Space Shuttle and Space Station; Chief of Astronaut Appearances; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control. A veteran of four space flights, Bursch has logged over 227 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-68 (1994) and STS-77 (1996), and served as flight engineer on ISS Expedition-Four (2001-2002). Dan Bursch and fellow astronaut Carl Walz currently hold the U.S. space flight endurance record of 196 days in space. In January 2003, Bursch reported to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA for a two year assignment as an instructor in the Space Systems Academic Group.\n[edit]\n\nSpace flight experience\n\nSTS-51 launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1993. During the ten-day mission the crew of five aboard the Shuttle Discovery deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Following a spacewalk by two crew members to evaluate Hubble Space Telescope repair tools, the crew initiated rendezvous burns and Bursch recovered the SPAS using the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The mission concluded on September 22, 1993, with the first night landing at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 236 hours and 11 minutes.\n\nSTS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 30, 1994. As part of NASA’s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour’s cargo bay to study Earth’s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth’s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 11, 1994. Mission duration was 269 hours and 46 minutes.\n\nSTS-77 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on May 19, 1996. It included the fourth Spacehab module flight as a scientific laboratory, designated SPACEHAB-4. It consisted of 12 separate materials processing, fluid physics and biotechnology experiments, with an emphasis on commercial space product development. STS-77 completed a record four rendezvous in support of two satellites sponsored by the Goddard Space Flight Center, and the SPARTAN 207/Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE) and the Passive Aerodynamically-stabilized Magnetically-damped Satellite/Satellite Test Unit (PAMS/STU). Following 160 orbits of the Earth, the ten-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at the Kennedy Space Center on May 29, 1996. Mission duration was 240 hours and 39 minutes.\n\nThe Expedition 4 crew launched on December 5, 2001 aboard STS-108 and docked with the International Space Station on December 7, 2001. During a 6-1/2 month stay aboard the Space Station, the Expedition 4 crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The crew spent 196 days in space establishing a U.S. space flight endurance record for Dan Bursch and crew mate Carl Walz. Wearing the Russian Orlan spacesuit, Bursch logged 11 hours and 48 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition-Four crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002.\n\nBursch retired from NASA in June 2005.")

	(description "The primary objective of the STS-93 mission was to deploy the Chandra X-ray Observatory (formerly Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility). At its launch, Chandra was the most sophisticated X-ray observatory ever built. It was designed to observe X-rays from high energy regions of the universe, such as hot gas in the remnants of exploded stars.\n\nOther payloads on STS-93 included the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLEX), the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS), the Gelation of Sols: Applied Microgravity Research (GOSAMR) experiment, the Space Tissue Loss - B (STL-B) experiment, a Light Weight Flexible Solar Array Hinge (LFSAH), the Cell Culture Module (CCM), the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment - II (SAREX - II), EarthKAM, Plant Growth Investigations in Microgravity (PGIM), the Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), the Micro-Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS), and the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC).\n\nThe Shuttle Ionespheric Modification with Pulsed Local Exhaust (SIMPLEX) payload activity researched the source of Very High Frequency (VHF) radar echoes caused by the orbiter and its OMS engine firings. The Principal Investigator (PI) used the collected data to examine the effects of orbital kinetic energy on ionospheric irregularities and to understand the processes that take place with the venting of exhaust materials.\n\nThe Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging system (SWUIS) was based around a Maksutov-design ultraviolet (UV) telescope and a UV-sensitive, image-intensified Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera that frames at video frame rates. Scientists can obtain sensitive photometric measurements of astronomical targets.\n\nThe objective Gelation of Sols: Applied Microgravity Research (GOSAMR) experiment was to investigate the influence of microgravity on the processing of gelled sols. In particular, the purpose was to demonstrate that composite ceramic precursors composed of large particulates and small colloidal sols can be produced in space with more structural uniformity.\n\nThe focus of the Space Tissue Loss - B (STL-B) experiment was direct video observation of cells in culture through the use of a video microscope imaging system with the objective of demonstrating near real-time interactive operations to detect and induce cellular responses.\n\nThe Light Weight Flexible Solar Array Hinge (LFSAH) payload consists of several hinges fabricated from shape memory alloys. Shape memory deployment hinges offered controlled shockless deployment of solar arrays and other spacecraft appendages. LFSAH demonstrated this deployment capability for a number of hinge configurations.\n\nThe objectives of the Cell Culture Module (CCM) were to validate models for muscle, bone, and endothelial cell biochemical and functional loss induced by microgravity stress; to evaluate cytoskeleton, metabolism, membrane integrity and protease activity in target cells; and to test tissue loss medications.\n\nThe Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment (SAREX-II) demonstrated the feasibility of amateur short-wave radio contacts between the shuttle and ground-based amateur radio operators. SAREX also served as an educational opportunity for schools around the world to learn about space by speaking directly to astronauts aboard the shuttle via ham radio.\n\nThe EarthKAM payload conducted Earth observations using the Electronic Still Camera (ESC) installed in the overhead starboard window of the Aft Flight Deck.\n\nThe Plant Growth Investigations in Microgravity (PGIM) payload experiment used plants to monitor the space flight environment for stressful conditions that affect plant growth. Because plants cannot move away from stressful conditions, they have developed mechanisms that monitor their environment and direct effective physiological responses to harmful conditions.\n\nThe Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payload hardware allows for sample processing and stowage functions. The Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus - Isothermal Containment Module (GBA-ICM) is temperature controlled to maintain a preset temperature environment, controls the activation and termination of the experiment samples, and provides an interface for crew interaction, control and data transfer.\n\nThe Micro-Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS) payload examines the performance, under launch, microgravity, and reentry conditions of a suite of MEMS devices. These devices include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and environmental and chemical sensors. The MEMS payload is self-contained and requires activation and deactivation only.\n\nThe Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) payload was designed to investigate the effects of space flight on small arthropod animals and plant specimens. The flight crew was available at regular intervals to monitor and control payload/experiment operations.\n\nColumbia's landing at Kennedy Space Center marked the 12th night landing in the Shuttle program's history. Five have been at Edwards Air Force Base in California and the rest have been at KSC. There have been 19 consecutive landings at KSC and 25 of the last 26 have been there.")

	(biography "Brigadier General Michel Tognini of the French Air Force (born September 30, 1949, in Vincennes, France) is a French test pilot and astronaut who currently serves as Head of the Astronaut Division of the European Space Agency. A veteran of two space flights, Tognini has logged a total of 19 days in space. Tognini has 4000 flight hours on 80 types of aircraft (mainly fighter aircraft including the MiG-25, Tupolev 154, Lightning MK-3 and MK-5, Gloster Meteor, and F-104). He is fluent in English and Russian.\n[edit]\n\nBiography\n\nFollowing graduation in 1973 from the Ecole de l'Air (the French Air Force Academy), Tognini was posted to advanced fighter pilot training at a squadron based at Normandie-Niemen where he served for one year before obtaining his advanced fighter pilot training. From 1974–1981, he served in the French Air Force as an operational fighter pilot (Cambrai Air Base), at the 12th Escadre de Chasse, flying SMB2 and Mirage F1 aircraft. During this tour of duty he served as flight leader in 1976, and flight commander in 1979.\n\nIn 1982, he was admitted to the Empire Test Pilot School in Boscombe Down, United Kingdom, and later that year was awarded his test pilot diploma. He was awarded his military studies diploma in 1983. Tognini was then posted to the Cazaux Flight Test Center, France, initially as a test pilot and subsequently as chief test pilot. During his time there, he helped test a great deal of French flight hardware. He did the weapon systems testing for the Mirage 2000-C, Mirage 2000-N, Jaguar ATLIS, and FLIR aircraft, and was also responsible for flight safety for pilots, experimenters and flight engineers.\n\nIn 1985, France opened a recruitment program to expand its astronaut corps, and Tognini was one of seven finalists selected. In July 1986, he was one of four candidates to undergo medical examinations in Moscow. In August 1986, he was assigned as the back-up for the Soyuz TM-7 mission. Although Tognini remained a French Air Force officer, he was placed on detachment to CNES for his space flight activities from September 1986 onwards. In November 1986 he reported to the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Russia, for alternate astronaut training, including EVA, for the Soviet-French ARAGATZ mission.\n\nDuring 1989–1990 he supported the Hermes program in Toulouse, France. In 1991 he returned to Star City, Russia, to start prime crew training for the 3rd Soviet-French ANTARES mission. During his stay in Russia, Tognini also gained piloting experience of BURAN simulators (MiG-25, Tupolev 154).\n\nTognini made his first space flight on July 27, 1992, aboard Soyuz TM-15 (returning on Soyuz TM-14, August 10). Together with Anatoly Solovyev and Sergei Avdeyev he linked up with Mir (ANTARES mission) and joined the crew of Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander Kaleri already on board. They spent 14 days carrying out a program of joint Soviet-French experiments before returning to Earth. He returned to France following the mission. During 1993–94, he attended a training cycle of the French Institute for High Studies of National Defense (IHEDN).\n\nTognini attended ASCAN Training at the Johnson Space Center during 1995. He was initially assigned to the Operations Planning Branch of the Astronaut Office working technical issues on the International Space Station, and was subsequently assigned to the Robotics Branch. Tognini was then assigned as ISS CAPCOM in Mission Control. Tognini flew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on STS-93 (July 22–27, 1999). During the 5-day mission his primary task was to assist in the deployment of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and to conduct a spacewalk if needed.\n[edit]\n\nHonors and awards\n\n    * French Aeronautics Medal\n    * Chevalier de Ordre National du Mérite\n    * Commander dans l'Ordre de la Légion d'Honneur\n    * Soviet Order of Friendship between the People\n    * Russian Order of Friendship between the People")

	(description "Mission Highlights\n\nThe main purpose of STS-105 is the rotation of the International Space Station crew and the delivery of supplies utilizing the Italian-built Multipurpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo on its second flight ( STS-102, STS-105 ). Astronauts will also perform two spacewalks and conduct scientific experiments. The MPLM on this mission contains additional scientific racks, equipment and supplies. It is 6.4 meters long (21 ft) and 4.6 meters (15 ft) in diameter) and weighs over 9,000 lb (4082 kg). An identical module named Raffaello has flown once (STS-100).\n\nAboard Leonardo are six Resupply Stowage Racks, four Resupply Stowage Platforms, and two new scientific experiment racks for the station's U.S. laboratory Destiny. The two new science racks (EXPRESS Racks 4 and 5) will add science capability to the station. EXPRESS stands for Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station. EXPRESS Rack 4 weighs 1,175 pounds (533 kg) and EXPRESS Rack 5 weighs 1,200 pounds (544 kg). The empty weight of each EXPRESS rack is about 785 pounds (356 kg). EXPRESS Racks 1 and 2A were delivered aboard the Raffaello cargo module during STS-100/6A in April 2001. EXPRESS Rack 3 is scheduled to be brought to the station during STS-111/UF-2 in 2002.\n\nThe Resuppy Stowage Racks and Resupply Stowage Platforms are filled with Cargo Transfer Bags that contain equipment and supplies for the station. The six Resuppply Stowage Racks contain almost 3,200 pounds (1451 kg) of cargo and the four Resupply Stowage Platforms contain about 1,200 pounds (544 kg) of cargo, not including the weight of the Cargo Transfer Bags, the foam packing around the cargo or the straps and fences that hold the bags in place. The total weight of cargo, racks and packing material aboard Leonardo is just over 11,000 pounds (4990 kg). Total cargo weight is about 6,775 pounds (3073 kg).\n\nAnother payload onboard is the Materials International Space Station Experiments (MISSE). This project is a NASA/Langley Research Center-managed cooperative endeavor to fly materials and other types of space exposure experiments on the space station. The objective is to develop early, low-cost, non-intrusive opportunities to conduct critical space exposure tests of space materials and components planned for use on future spacecraft. Johnson Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Center, the Materials Laboratory at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Boeing Phantom Works are participants with Langley in the project. The MISSE experiments will be the first externally mounted experiments conducted on the ISS. The experiments are in four Passive Experiment Containers (PECs) that were initially developed and used for an experiment on Mir in 1996 during the Shuttle-Mir Program. The PECs were transported to Mir on STS-76. After an 18-month exposure in space, they were retrieved on STS-86. PECs are suitcase-like containers for transporting experiments via the space shuttle to and from an orbiting spacecraft. Once on orbit and clamped to the host spacecraft, the PECs are opened and serve as racks to expose experiments to the space environment.\n\nOther payloads onboard are part of the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility Shuttle Small Payloads Project. The SSPP system utilizes payload carrier systems such as the Hitchhiker, Getaway Specials and Space Experiment Modules to provide a low cost scientific research environment. SSPP payloads on STS-105 include the Hitchhiker payload Simplesat, The Cell Growth in Microgravity GAS Canister (G-708), the Microgravity Smoldering Combustion experimet (MSC), and the Hitchiker Experiment Advancing Technology Space Experiment Module-10 payload).")

She landed successfully on Mars on January 24, 2004 at 21:05 PST (January 25 05:05 UTC). Her twin Spirit landed on Mars three weeks earlier on January 3, 2004.

Although Meridiani is a flat plain, without the rockfields seen at previous Mars landing sites, Opportunity rolled into Eagle crater, a small impact crater approximately 20 meters in diameter and it would be two weeks before she stuck a camera up to get a better look of her surroundings.\n\nOn 2004 January 28, NASA announced that the landing site was being named in honor of the seven astronauts of the final mission of space shuttle Challenger, killed 18 years ago this day when the shuttle exploded shortly after launch.\n[edit]\n\nMission duration\n\nThe primary mission for Opportunity was planned to last 90 sols. The mission received several extensions and by October, 2005 had passed 605 sols.\n[edit]\n\nEvents and discoveries\n[edit]\n\nTimeline\n\nA detailed chronology of events and discoveries may be found in the Opportunity rover timeline entry. The following paragraphs discuss the more notable findings.\n[edit]\n\nFirst panorama\n\nThis 360-degree panorama is the first panorama beamed back to Earth from the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity shortly after she touched down at Meridiani Planum, Mars. The image was captured by the rover's navigation camera.\nimage:Merbfirst.jpg\n[edit]\n\nFirst color panorama\n\nThis color image shows the martian landscape at Meridiani Planum, where the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity successfully landed at 9:05 p.m. PST on January 24, 2004. This is one of the first images beamed back to Earth from the rover shortly after she touched down. The image was captured by the rover's panoramic camera.\n[edit]\n\nOpportunity lands in a crater\n\nThe interior of a crater surrounding the Opportunity at Meridiani Planum on Mars can be seen in this color image from the rover's panoramic camera. This was the darkest landing site ever visited by a spacecraft on Mars. The rim of the crater was approximately 10 meters (32 feet) from the rover. The crater is estimated to be 20 meters (65 feet) in diameter. Scientists were intrigued by the abundance of rock outcrops dispersed throughout the crater, as well as the crater's soil, which appeared to be a mixture of coarse gray grains and fine reddish grains. NASA Scientists were so excited about landing in a crater that they called the landing a \"hole in one.\" Later, the crater was named Eagle crater.\nimage:MERB_Sol1_Postcard-B002R1_th544.jpg\n[edit]\n\n\"Opportunity Ledge\" outcroppings\n\nThis sweeping look at the unusual rock outcropping near Opportunity was captured by the rover's panoramic camera. Scientists believe the seemingly layered rocks are either volcanic ash deposits or sediments laid down by wind or water. It was given the name Opportunity Ledge.\nThis panorama of Eagle crater shows outcroppings\n\nGeologists said that the layers—some no thicker than a finger—indicate the rocks likely originated either from sediments carried by water or wind, or from falling volcanic ash. \"We should be able to distinguish between those two hypotheses,\" said Dr. Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, Cambridge, a member of the science team for Opportunity and her twin, Spirit. If the rocks are sedimentary, water is a more likely source than wind, he said.\nClose up of an outcrop rock\nEnlarge\nClose up of an outcrop rock\n\nThese layered rocks measure only 10 centimeters (4 inches) tall and are thought to be either volcanic ash deposits or sediments carried by water or wind. The layers are very thin measuring just a few millimeters thick in some cases.\n\nOn Sol 15, Opportunity took a close up of the rock Stone Mountain in the outcrop area of the crater.\n\nFrom this picture it was speculated, that it does consist of very fine grain or dust. This is in contrast to Sandstone on Earth, which is compacted sand with rather large grains. Also, the weathering agent eroding away layers of this rock seems to be visible (dark spots).\n\n\"Embedded in it like blueberries in a muffin are these little spherical grains,\" said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., principal investigator for the rovers' scientific instruments. He also said: \"One other teasure, a clue that just popped up, not gonna quote any numbers yet, but we have now completed an APXS measurement on the outcrop and it has got a lot of sulfur in it. Maybe a few times more sulfur than we've seen on any other location on Mars.\"\nThin Rock layers, not all parallel to each other\nEnlarge\nThin Rock layers, not all parallel to each other\n\nA picture received on February 10 (and taken on Sol 16) had mission scientists excited. It showed that the thin layers in the bedrock are not always parallel. Instead, if you look closely at this image from an angle, you will notice that the lines converge and diverge at low angles. These unparallel lines give unparalleled clues that some \"moving current\" such as volcanic flow, wind, or water formed these rocks.\n\nThese layers with converging and diverging lines were a significant discovery for scientists who planned this mission to rigorously test the water hypothesis.\n\nOn February 19 the survey of Opportunity Ledge was declared successful. \"We've planned our assault on the outcrop,\" said Dr. Squyres. A specific target in the outcrop (dubbed El Capitan) was selected for further investigation. \"The whole stack of rocks seems to be well exposed here,\" he said of the chosen target. Upper and lower portions appear to differ in layering and weathering characteristics.\n\nOpportunity reached El Capitan on Sol 27, and took first picture of the rocks with her Panoramic camera.\nClose up view of El Capitan\nEnlarge\nClose up view of El Capitan\n\nThe image to the left shows a close up view of the layering in one section of this rock. El Capitan was named after a mountain in Texas, but on Mars, it is about 10 centimeters (4 inches) high. The upper and lower portions of El Capitan have different textures, and it was hoped that both areas could provide distinct and unique clues about the history of Mars.\n\nOn Sol 30, Opportunity used her Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) for the first time to investigate the rocks around El Capitan.\nSection of hole created by RAT\nEnlarge\nSection of hole created by RAT\n\nThe image on the right-hand side shows a close up view taken after the drilling and cleaning process was complete. Due to chance, two spherules were also cut partially, and seem to show scratches and other marks made by the diamond-crusted grind tool. The black areas are artifacts of the imaging process, when parts of the picture are missing.\n\nDuring a press conference on March 2 missions scientist discussed their conclusions about the bedrock, and the evidence for the presence of liquid water during their formation. They presented the following reasoning to explain the small, elongated voids in the rock visible on the surface and after grinding into it:\nVoids inside the rock\nEnlarge\nVoids inside the rock\n\nThese voids are consistent with features known to geologists as \"vugs\". These are formed when crystals form inside a rock matrix and are later removed through erosive processes, leaving behind voids. Some of the features in this picture are \"disk-like\", which is consistent with certain types of crystals, notably sulfate minerals.\n\nAdditionally, mission members presented first data from the Mossbauer spectrometer taken at the bedrock site. The iron spectrum obtained from the rock El Capitan shows strong evidence for the mineral jarosite. This mineral contains hydroxyl molecules, which indicates the presence of water when the minerals were formed. Mini-TES data from the same rock showed that it consists of a considerable amount of sulfates.\n[edit]\n\nHematite\n\nGeologists were eager to reach a hematite-rich area (in the center of the picture below) to closely examine the soil, which may reveal secrets about how the hematite got to this location. Knowing how the hematite on Mars was formed may help scientists characterize the past environment and determine whether that environment provided favorable conditions for life.\n\n\"Grey hematite is a mineral indicator of past water,\" said Dr. Joy Crisp, JPL project scientist. \"It is not always associated with water, but it often is.\"\nThe distribution of hematite in Sinus Meridiani, where Meridiani Planum is located\nEnlarge\nThe distribution of hematite in Sinus Meridiani, where Meridiani Planum is located\n\nScientists have wanted to find out which of these processes created grey hematite on Mars since 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor spotted large concentrations of the mineral near the planet's equator (seen in the left picture). This discovery provided the first mineral evidence that Mars' history may have included water.\n\n\"We want to know if the grains of hematite appear to be rounded and cemented together by the action of liquid water or if they're crystals that grew from a volcanic melt,\" said Crisp. \"Is the hematite in layers, which would suggest that it was laid down by water, or in veins in the rock, which would be more characteristic of water having flowed through the rocks.\"\n\nThe next picture shows a mineral map, the first ever made on the surface of another planet, that was generated from a section of the panorama picture overlayed with data taken from the rover's Mini-TES. The Mini-TES spectral data was analyzed in a way that the concentration of the mineral hematite was deduced and its level coded in color. Red and orange mean high concentration, green and blue low concentration.\nThis spectral map of Eagle crater shows hematite.\n\nThe next picture shows a hematite abundance \"index map\" that helps geologists choose hematite-rich locations to visit around Opportunity's landing site. Blue dots equal areas low in hematite and red dots equal areas high in hematite. The colored dots represent data collected by the miniature thermal emission spectrometer on Sol 11, after Opportunity had rolled off of the lander and the rover was located at the center of the blue semi-circle. (The spectrometer is located on the panoramic camera mast.)\nhematite abundance index map\nEnlarge\nhematite abundance index map\n\nThe area to the left (with high concentration of hematite) was selected by mission members for further investigation, and called Hematite Slope.\n\nDuring Sol 23 (February 16) Opportunity successfully trenched the soil at Hematite Slope and started to investigate the details of the layering.\n[edit]\n\nSpherical Granules (Spherules)\nThis colour-enhanced image shows spherical granules\nEnlarge\nThis colour-enhanced image shows spherical granules\n\nMicroscopic images of the soil taken by Opportunity revealed small, spherically shaped granules. They were first seen on pictures taken on Sol 10, right after the rover drove from the lander onto martian soil. The shapes by themselves don't reveal the particles' origin with certainty. \"A number of straightforward geological processes can yield round shapes,\" said Dr. Hap McSween, a rover science team member from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. They include accretion under water, but apparent pores in the particles make alternative possibilities of meteor impacts or volcanic eruptions more likely origins, he said.\n\nFor example, ranging in size from less than 100 micrometres to more than 250 micrometres, similar spherules were found in Moon soil samples collected by Apollo 12 at the Procellarum Basin, and Apollo 14 near Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains), the dark crater that dominates the Moon's face (1), and their properties were consistent with expectations for creation by meteor impacts (2).\nMosaic shows some spherules partly embedded.\nEnlarge\nMosaic shows some spherules partly embedded.\n\nIn this picture, you can see them spread over the (smaller) soil grains. \"We see these strange round objects we're calling \"spherules\" embedded in the outcrop, like blueberries in a muffin. The outcrop erodes away as it gets sandblasted, and the spherules (which seem to resist erosion better than the rest of the outcrop does) fall out and roll down the hill. Weird.\" said Squyres. The spheres may have formed when molten rock was sprayed into the air by a volcano or a meteor impact. Or, they may be concretions, or accumulated material, formed by minerals coming out of solution as water diffused through rock, he said on a February 9 press conference.\n\nOne of the questions about the spherules was if they can be found in the deeper layers of the soil on Mars. When Opportunity dug her first trench (Sol 23), pictures of the lower layers showed similar round spherules. But this time they had a very shiny surface, that created strong glints and glares. \"They appear shiny or polished,\" said Albert Yen, science team member, during a press conference on February 19. He said: \"Data will hopefully help us figure out what's altering them.\" At the same press briefing, Dr. Squyres noted this as one of the main question: \"Where did those spherules come from, dropped from above or grown in place?\"\n\nMission scientists reported on March 2 that they concluded a survey of the distribution of spherules in the bedrock. They found that they spread out evenly and randomly inside the rocks, and not in layers. This supports the notion that they grew in place, since if their origin was related to volcanic or meteoric episodes one would expect layers of spherules as a \"record in time\" for each event. This observation was added to the list of evidence for liquid water being present at this rock site, where it is thought the spherules formed.\nThe rock \"Berry Bowl\"\nEnlarge\nThe rock \"Berry Bowl\"\n\nOn March 18 the results of the investigation of the area called \"Berry Bowl\" was announced. This site is a large rock with a small, bowl-shaped depression, in which a large number of spherules had accumulated. The Moessbauer spectrometer was used to analyze the depression and then the area of the rock right beside it. Any difference in the measured data were then attributed to the material in the spherules. A large difference in the obtained \"spectra\" was found. \"This is the fingerprint of hematite, so we conclude that the major iron-bearing mineral in the berries is hematite,\" said Daniel Rodionov, a rover science team collaborator from the University of Mainz, Germany. This discovery seems to strengthen the conclusion, that spherules are concretions, grown in wet condition with dissolved iron.\n[edit]\n\nOpportunity digs a trench\nThis image, taken by the microscopic imager, reveals shiny, spherical objects embedded within the trench wall\nEnlarge\nThis image, taken by the microscopic imager, reveals shiny, spherical objects embedded within the trench wall\n\nThe rover alternately pushed soil forward and backward out of the trench with its right front wheel while other wheels held the rover in place. The rover turned slightly between bouts of digging to widen the hole. \"We took a patient, gentle approach to digging,\" Biesiadecki said. The process lasted 22 minutes.\n\nThe resulting trench—the first dug by either Mars Exploration Rover—is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) long and 10 centimeters (4 inches) deep. \"It came out deeper than I expected,\" said Dr. Rob Sullivan of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., a science-team member who worked closely with engineers to plan the digging.\n\nTwo features that caught scientists' attention were the clotty texture of soil in the upper wall of the trench and the brightness of soil on the trench floor, Sullivan said.\n\nBy inspecting the sides and floor of a hole it dug on Mars, NASA's Opportunity rover is finding some things it did not see beforehand, including round pebbles that are shiny and soil so fine-grained that the rover's microscope can't make out individual particles.\n\n\"What's underneath is different than what's at the immediate surface,\" said Dr. Albert Yen, rover science team member at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.\n[edit]\n\n\"Drenched in water\"\n\nOn March 2, 2004, NASA announced that \"Opportunity has landed in an area of Mars where liquid water once drenched the surface\". Associate administrator Ed Weiler told reporters that the area \"would have been good habitable environment\", although no traces of life have yet been found.\nLarger Grains Suggest Presence of Fluid\nEnlarge\nLarger Grains Suggest Presence of Fluid\n\nThis statement was made during a press conference, where mission scientists listed a number of observations that strongly support this view:\n\n\n    * Distributions of spherules\n\n    Hypothesis: Spherules are concretions created in water as a solvent.\n    Competing hypothesis: Spherules are rehardened molten rock droplets, created by volcanoes or meteor strikes.\n    Supporting data: Location of spherules in the rock matrix is random and evenly spread.\n    Quote from Steve Squyres: \"The little spherules like blueberries in a muffin are embedded in this rock and weathering out of it. Three ideas, lapilli, little volcanic hailstones, one possibility. Two, droplets of volcanic glass or impact. We've looked at these things very carefully. Probably concretions. If so, it's pointing towards water.\"\n\nIn the lower left, a spherule can be seen penetrating the interior of a vug\nEnlarge\nIn the lower left, a spherule can be seen penetrating the interior of a vug\n\n    * Vugs\n\n    Hypothesis: Rock was formed in water, for instance by precipitation.\n    Competing hypothesis: Rock were formed by ash deposits.\n    Supporting data: Voids found in bedrock resemble \"vugs\" which are left by eroded away disk-shaped crystals, possible dissolved in a watery environment.\n    Quote from Steve Squyres: Second piece of evidence is that when we looked at it closeup, it was shot through with tabular holes. Familiar forms. When crystals grow within rocks, precipitated from water. If they're tabular, as they grow you can get tabular crystals and water chem changes and they go away or they weather away.\"\n\n    * Sulfates and jarosite\n\n    Hypothesis: Water created tell-tale salt chemicals in the rock.\n    Competing hypothesis: Chemistry of rocks is determined by volcanic processes.\n    Supporting data: Sulfate salts and jarosite mineral were found in the rock. On Earth they are made in standing water (possibly during evaporation).\n    Quote from Steve Squyres: \"Next piece of evidence comes from APXS. We found it looked like a lot of sulfur. That was the outside of the rock. We brought with us a grinding tool, the RAT and we ground away 2-4 mm and found even more sulfur. Too much to explain by other than that this rock is full of sulfate salts. That's a telltale sign of liquid water. Mini-TES also found evidence of sulfate salts. Most compelling of all, the Mossbauer spectrometer in the RATted space showed compelling evidence of Jarosite, an iron sulfate hydrate. Fairly rare, found on earth and had been predicted that it might be found on Mars some day. This is a mineral that you got to have water around to make.\"\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst atmospheric temperature profile\n\nDuring a press conference on March 11, 2004, mission scientists presented the first temperature profile of the martian atmosphere ever measured. It was obtained by combining data taken from the Opportunity Mini-TES camera with data from the TES instrument onboard the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter. This was necessary because Opportunity can only see up to 6 km high, and the MGS camera can not measure data all the way down to the ground. The data was acquired on February 15 (Sol 22) and is split into two data sets: Since the orbiter is in motion, some data was taken while it was approaching the Opportunity site, other when it was moving away. In the graph, these sets are marked \"inbound\" (black color) and \"outbound\" (red color). Also, the dots represent Mini-TES (= rover) data and the straight lines are TES (=orbiter) data.\n[edit]\n\nFormer Martian sea\n\nOn March 23, 2004, NASA announced that they believe that Opportunity had not landed in a location merely \"drenched in water\", but on what was once a coastal area. \"We think Opportunity is parked on what was once the shoreline of a salty sea on Mars,\" said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University.\nCrossbedding features in rock \"Last Chance\"\nEnlarge\nCrossbedding features in rock \"Last Chance\"\n\nThe announcement was based on evidence of sedimentary rocks that are consistent with those formed by water and not wind. \"Bedding patterns in some finely layered rocks indicate the sand-sized grains of sediment that eventually bonded together were shaped into ripples by water at least five centimeters (two inches) deep, possibly much deeper, and flowing at a speed of 10 to 50 centimeters (four to 20 inches) per second,\" said Dr. John Grotzinger, from MIT. The landing site was likely a salt flat on the edge of a large body of water that was covered by shallow water.\n\nOther evidence includes findings of chlorine and bromine in the rocks, which indicates the rocks had at least soaked in mineral-rich water, possibly from underground sources, after they formed. Increased assurance of the bromine findings strengthens the case that rock-forming particles precipitated from surface water as salt concentrations climbed past saturation while water was evaporating.\n[edit]\n\nEndurance Crater\n\nOn April 30, 2004 Opportunity reached the crater called 'Endurance'.\nEndurance Crater\nEnlarge\nEndurance Crater\n\nScientists were eager to reach this crater, since even from afar it was seen that many layers of rocks can be studied at this site.\n\nDuring the month of May the rover drove around the crater to scout all areas of it. This included observations with Mini-TES and the panoramic camera. Additionally, the rock dubbed 'Lion Stone' was investigated closely, and found to be similar in composition to the layers found in Eagle crater.\nRock layer inside Endurance at Karatepe\nEnlarge\nRock layer inside Endurance at Karatepe\n\nOn June 4, 2004 mission members announced their intention to drive Opportunity into Endurance, even if it should turn out to be impossible to get back out. The target of this drive are the various rock layers that were identified in the pictures from the crater rim. \"This is a crucial and careful decision for the Mars Exploration Rovers' extended mission,\" said Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science. Dr Squyres, principal investigator from Cornell University said: \"Answering the question of what came before the evaporites is the most significant scientific issue we can address with Opportunity at this time.\"\n\nA first drive into the crater was executed June 8 and Opportunity backed out again the same day. It was found that the angle of the surface was well inside the safety margin (about 18 degrees), and the full excursion towards the rock layer of interest was started. During Sols 134 (June 12), 135, and 137 the rover drove deeper and deeper into the crater, each time executing the drive exactly as planned.\n\nOpportunity spent roughly 180 sols inside the crater, before backing out of it again in late December 2004.\n[edit]\n\nHeat shield and meteorite\nHeat shield, with Heat Shield Rock just above and to the left in the background (click to enlarge)\nEnlarge\nHeat shield, with Heat Shield Rock just above and to the left in the background (click to enlarge)\nHeat Shield Rock\nEnlarge\nHeat Shield Rock\n\nAfter exiting Endurance crater, in January 2005 Opportunity went to examine its own discarded heat shield. While in the vicinity of the heat shield, it happened to come upon an object which was immediately suspected and soon confirmed to be a meteorite. The meteorite was promptly named Heat Shield Rock, and is the first meteorite identified on another planet or moon.\n[edit]\n\nMoving farther south\n\nAfter about 25 Sols of observations on the heat shield and the meteorite, Opportunity headed south for a crater named Argo. Near its destination, nearly 300 m from the heat shield, the rover was commanded to dig another trench on the vast plains of Meridiani Planum. The dig took place on Sol 366 and observations continued until Sol 373 (February 10, 2005).\n\nContinuing even farther, the rover has passed the craters of Alvin and Jason, and by Sol 387, approached three small craters (referred to as a crater triplet), on its way to Vostok Crater.\n\nOn its trek to the south, Opportunity traveled more distance in one day than by either rover previously: 177.5 meters (582 feet), on February 19, 2005. Opportunity's total distance for its mission as of March 3, 2005, has been 3,014 meters (1.87 miles).\n\nOn Sol 389 (February 26, 2005), the rover approached one of the three craters, dubbed Naturaliste. A rock target named \"Normandy\" was chosen for investigation on Sol 392, and Opportunity remained there until Sol 395.\n\nOpportunity reached Vostok Crater on Sol 399, finding that most of the crater had been filled with sand but outcrops outline the edges. After leaving Vostok, the plan was to head farther south into what has been called \"etched terrain\", where more bedrock might be found.\n360° Panorama at crater triplet, all three craters in right half of image, Naturaliste Crater in foreground.\nEnlarge\n360° Panorama at crater triplet, all three craters in right half of image, Naturaliste Crater in foreground.\n\nBy Sol 415, Opportunity stopped by some soil ripples to investigate the differences between soil in the trough of a ripple and its crest. Various soil targets included \"Mobarak\" in the trough, named in honor of Persian New Year, and \"Norooz\" and \"Mayberooz\" on the crest. By Sol 421, the rover left the ripple for a crater dubbed Viking.\n[edit]\n\nDug in\nWikinews\nWikinews has news related to this article:\nMars Exploration Rover Opportunity gets stuck in a small sand dune\n\nOn April 26 (Sol 446) Opportunity dug itself into a sand dune. Mission scientists reported that images taken that day indicate that all four corner wheels have dug in by more than a wheel radius, just as the rover attempted to climb over a dune about 30 centimeters (12 inches) tall. It was planned to simulate the rover's situation on Earth before attempting any more movements. During that time the mission plan focused on remote sensing.\n\nAfter testing various materials to simulate the properties of the sand dune on Earth, the rover executed its first wheel movements on May 13 (Sol 463). The rover intentionally advanced only a few centimeters, and mission members evaluated the results.\nDug in back wheels on Sol 468\nEnlarge\nDug in back wheels on Sol 468\n\nDuring Sol 465 and 466 more drive commands were executed, with each trial the rover moved another couple of centimeters. At the end of each movement, panoramic images were acquired to investigate the atmosphere and the surrounding dune field.\n\nOn June 4 (Sol 484), it was announced that the sand dune escape maneuver was successful and all six wheels of Opportunity were now on firmer ground.\n\nOpportunity is currently traveling on a southerly course towards Victoria crater, a massive impact crater approximately 7km from the original landing site. Victoria's diameter is six times larger than Endurance crater. Scientists believe that rock outcrops along the walls of Victoria will yield more information about the geologic history of Mars, if the rover survives long enough to investigate them.\n\nOpportunity's total odometry as of sol 605 was 6,009.88 meters (3.73 miles).\n[edit]\n\nAstronomy\n\nOpportunity pointed its cameras towards the sky and observed transits of Phobos and transits of Deimos across the Sun.\n\nOpportunity also photographed the Earth in the sky, appearing as a bright star.\n\nA transit of Mercury from Mars took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 UTC to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both Opportunity and Spirit, however camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of Deimos across the Sun, but at 2' angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by JPL Horizons indicates that Opportunity would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while Spirit would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC Earth time until the end of the transit.\n[edit]\n\nHonors\n\nHonoring Opportunity's great contribution to the exploration of Mars, the asteroid 39382 has been named Opportunity. The name was proposed by Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld who along with Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Tom Gehrels discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.\n[edit]\n\nRelated articles\n\n    * Exploration of Mars\n    * Space exploration\n    * Unmanned space missions\n    * Spirit rover\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal References\n\n    * (1) Paper about analysis of Moon Spherules\n    * (2) APOD page about Moon Spherules\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal links\n\n    * SpaceFlightNow Status Page\n    * JPL's Mars Exploration Rover home page\n    * Mission Status updates from NASA JPL\n    * Finding Opportunity: high resolution images of landing site (Mars Global Surveyor - Mars Orbiter Camera)\n    * Finding Opportunity: interactive Mars atlas based on Viking images: you can zoom in/out and pan images, to find your preferred site\n    * MER Imagery: automatically generated 3D stereo anaglyphs and pseudo-color images based on JPL raw images\n    * (AXCH) 2004 Mars Exploration Rovers Highlights - News, status, technical info, history, and more.\n    * Wikisource:NASA MER press briefings\n\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover\"\n\nCategories: Cleanup from April 2005 | Mars missions | Robots | Mars Exploration Rover\nViews\nMediaWiki\nWikimedia Foundation\n\n    * This page was last modified 15:40, 17 October 2005.\n    * All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (see Copyrights for details).\n    * About Wikipedia\n    * Disclaimers")

	(biography "Francis Richard \"Dick\" Scobee (May 19, 1939 - January 28, 1986) was an American astronaut who died commanding the Space Shuttle Challenger, which suffered catastrophic booster failure during launch of the STS-51-L mission.\n\nBorn in Cle Elum, Washington, Scobee enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1957, where he served as a reciprocating engine mechanic at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. While off duty, he attended college, and eventually received a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Arizona in 1965; the same year, he was awarded an officer's commission. Afterward, he attended flight school and earned his wings in 1966, serving as a combat aviator in the Vietnam War. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal, and other decorations.\n\nAfter his tour of duty, Scobee attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, just outside Los Angeles, California. Upon graduation in 1972, he became an Air Force test pilot, logging thousands of hours of flight time in dozens of aircraft, including the Boeing 747, the experimental X-24B lifting body, the F-111 Aardvark, and the gigantic C-5 Galaxy. Scobee retired a Lieutenant colonel.\n\nSelected for NASA's astronaut program in January 1978, Scobee completed his training in August 1979. While awaiting his first orbital spaceflight mission, he served as an instructor pilot for the shuttle's 747 carrier aircraft. In April 1984, Scobee piloted Challenger mission STS-41-C, which successfully deployed one satellite and repaired another.\n\nScobee was elevated to the role of spacecraft commander for the ill-fated 51-L mission. The mission, designed to deploy a satellite to study the approaching Halley's Comet and to inaugurate the Teacher in Space Project, was delayed numerous times due to bad weather and technical glitches. When the mission finally did lift off the pad, an O-ring seal failure caused a massive explosion 73 seconds into the flight, killing Scobee and the other six members of the crew; the tragedy, viewed live on national television, prompted several days of national mourning, as well as a major shakeup at NASA.\n\nLaid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, Scobee was survived by his wife June (nee Kent) and two children, Kathie and Richard. In his spare time, he loved all forms of outdoor activity, as well as flying, oil painting, woodworking, riding motorcycles, playing racquetball, and running. In 2004, Scobee was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame.\n[edit]\n\nExternal links")

She was born Sharon Christa Corrigan in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMcAuliffe was selected to be the first teacher in space on July 19, 1985. She joined the STS 51-L crew as a mission specialist with plans to teach lessons from space.\n\nSelected from among more than 11,000 applicants from the education profession for entrance into the astronaut ranks, McAuliffe was the oldest child of Edward and Grace Corrigan. The year she was born, her father was completing his sophomore year at Boston College. Not long thereafter he took a job as an assistant comptroller in a Boston department store and the family moved to the Boston suburb of Framingham, where she attended Framingham High School and graduated from Marian High School in 1966. As a youth she was inspired by the Apollo moon landing program, and wrote years later on her astronaut application form that \"I watched the Space Age being born and I would like to participate.\"\n\nMcAuliffe attended Framingham State College in her hometown, graduating in 1970. A few weeks later she married her longstanding boyfriend, Steven McAuliffe, and they moved to the Washington, DC metropolitan area so Steven could attend the Georgetown University Law Center. She took a job teaching in the secondary schools, specializing in American history and social studies. They stayed in the Washington area for the next eight years, she teaching and completing a Master of Arts from Bowie State University in Maryland. They moved to Concord, New Hampshire in 1978 when Steven accepted a job as an assistant to the state attorney general. Christa took a teaching post at Concord High School in 1982, and in 1984 learned about NASA's efforts to locate an educator to fly on the shuttle. The intent was to find a gifted teacher who could communicate with students while in orbit.\n\nNASA selected McAuliffe for this position in the summer of 1984 and in the fall she took a year-long leave of absence from teaching (NASA paid her salary), and trained for an early 1986 shuttle mission. She had an immediate rapport with the media, and the teacher in space program received tremendous popular attention as a result.

This is the fourth of nine planned missions to Mir between 1995 and 1998 and the first exchange of astronauts. Astronaut Shannon W. Lucid, who has been on Mir since late March, will be replaced on Mir by astronaut John E. Blaha. Blaha will spend more than four months on Mir. He will return to Earth on Space Shuttle Mission STS-81, scheduled for launch in January 1997.\n\nSTS-79 is the second Shuttle-Mir mission to carry a SPACEHAB module on board, and the first to carry a double module. The forward portion of the double module will house experiments conducted by the crew before, during and after Atlantis is docked to the Russian space station. The aft portion of the double module primarily houses the logistics equipment to be transferred to the Russian space station. Logistics include food, clothing, experiment supplies, and spare equipment for Mir.\n\nSTS-79 highlighted by return to Earth of U.S. astronaut Lucid after 188 days in space, first U.S. crew exchange aboard Russian Space Station Mir, and fourth Shuttle-Mir docking. Lucid’s long-duration spaceflight set new U.S. record as well as world record for a woman. She embarked to Mir March 22 with STS-76 mission. Succeeding her on Mir for an approximately four-month stay is Blaha, who will return in January 1997 with STS-81 crew; U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger will replace him.\n\nSTS-79 also marked second flight of SPACEHAB module in support of Shuttle-Mir activities and first flight of SPACEHAB Double Module configuration. Shuttle-Mir linkup occurred at 11:13 p.m. EDT, Sept. 18, following R-bar approach. Hatches opened at 1:40 a.m., Sept. 19, and Blaha and Lucid exchanged places at 7 a.m. EDT. Awaiting Blaha on Mir were Valery Korzun, Mir 22 commander, and Alexander Kaleri, flight engineer.\n\nDuring five days of mated operations, two crews transferred more than 4,000 pounds (1,814 kg) of supplies to Mir, including logistics, food and water generated by orbiter fuel cells. Three experiments also were transferred: Biotechnology System (BTS) for study of cartilage development; Material in Devices as Superconductors (MIDAS) to measure electrical properties of high-temperature superconductor materials; and Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA), containing several smaller experiments, including self-contained aquatic systems.\n\nAbout 2,000 pounds (907 kg) of experiment samples and equipment transferred from Mir to Atlantis; total logistical transfer to and from station of more than 6,000 pounds (2,722 kg) was most extensive to date. During her approximately six-month stay on Mir, Lucid conducted research in following fields: advanced technology, Earth sciences, fundamental biology, human life sciences, microgravity research and space sciences. Specific experiments included: Environmental Radiation Measurements to ascertain ionizing radiation levels aboard Mir; Greenhouse-Integrated Plant Experiments, to study effect of microgravity on plants, specifically dwarf wheat; and Assessment of Humoral Immune Function During Long-Duration Space Flight, to gather data on effect of long-term spaceflight on the human immune system and involving collection of blood serum and saliva samples. Some research conducted in newest and final Mir module, Priroda, which arrived at station during Lucid’s stay.\n\nThree experiments remained on Atlantis: Extreme Temperature Translation Furnace (ETTF), a new furnace design allowing space-based processing up to 871 degrees Fahrenheit (1,600 degrees Celsius) and above; Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) complement of 128 individual samples involving 12 different proteins; and Mechanics of Granular Materials, designed to further understanding of behavior of cohesionless granular materials, which could in turn lead to better understanding of how Earth’s surface responds during earthquakes and landslides.\n\nAs with all Shuttle-Mir flights, risk-mitigation experiments were conducted to help reduce development risk for the International Space Station. Flying for first time was the Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS), an experiment rack designed to cushion payloads from vibration and other disturbances.\n\nConducted near end of flight was test using orbiter’s small vernier jets to lower Atlantis’ orbit. Similar maneuver may be employed at end of second Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, STS-82, to re-boost Hubble to a higher orbit while still in orbiter payload bay.")

	(biography "Ellison Shoji Onizuka (June 24, 1946 - January 28, 1986) was an American astronaut from Kealakekua, Kona, Hawai'i who died during the explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger, where he was serving as mission specialist on mission STS-51-L.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Early life\n    * 2 Air Force career\n    * 3 NASA career\n    * 4 Memberships and distinctions\n    * 5 Legacy\n    * 6 External Links\n    * 7 References\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\nEllison Onizuka was the oldest son and second youngest child of the late Masamitsu and Mitsue Onizuka's children. He had two older sisters, Shirley and Norma, and a younger brother, Claude. Claude became the family spokesman when Ellison attained fame as an astronaut and continued after the Challenger accident. Growing up Ellison was an active participant in 4-H and Boy Scouts, where he reached the level of Eagle Scout.\n\nHe graduated from Konawaena High School in Kealakekua in 1964. He received a Bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering in June 1969, and a Master's in that field in December of the same year, from the University of Colorado. He participated in Air Force ROTC during his time there.\n\nOnizuka married Lorna Leiko Yoshida while completing his studies at the University of Colorado. They had two daughters, Janelle Mitsue (b. 1968) and Darien Lei Shizue (b. 1975).\n[edit]\n\nAir Force career\n\nIn January 1970, Onizuka entered active duty with the United States Air Force, where he served as a flight test engineer and as a test pilot. At the Sacramento Air Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base, he worked in test flight programs and systems security engineering for the F-84, F-100, F-105, F-111, EC-121T, T-33, T-39, T-28, and A-1.\n\nFrom August 1974 to July 1975, Onizuka attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. In July 1975, he was assigned to the Test Flight Center at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He became a squadron test flight engineer at the Test Pilot School, and later worked as a manager for engineering support in the training resources division. His duties there were based on the instruction of courses and the management of all flight test modifications for all of the airship fleet (A-7, A-37, T-38, F-4, T-33, and NKC-135) being used for the Test Pilot School and Test Flight Center. Onizuka managed to register more than 1,700 flight hours.\n[edit]\n\nNASA career\n\nOnizuka was selected for the astronaut program in January 1978, and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979. Later, he worked in the experimentation team, Orbiter test team, and launch support crew at the Kennedy Space Center for the STS-1 and STS-2. At NASA, he worked on the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test and revision software team. He also collaborated on other technical projects, for instance, as astronaut crew team coordinator.\n\nHis first space mission took place on January 24, 1985, with the Kennedy Space Center launch of mission STS 51-C on Space Shuttle Discovery, the first space shuttle mission for the Department of Defense. Onizuka was accompanied by the commander Ken Mattingly, pilot Loren Shriver, fellow mission specialist James Buchli, and payload specialist Gary E. Payton. During the mission, Onizuka was responsible for the activities of the primary payloads, which included the unfolding of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) surface. After 48 orbits around the Earth, Discovery landed at the Kennedy Space Center on January 27, 1985. Onizuka had completed a total of 74 hours in space.\n\nOnizuka was assigned to the mission STS 51-L on the Space Shuttle Challenger that took off from Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 EST (16:38:00 UTC) on January 28, 1986. The other Challenger crew members were commander Dick Scobee, pilot Michael Smith, mission specialists Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik, and Gregory Jarvis, and payload specialist Christa McAuliffe. The challenger exploded at 73 seconds after launch. All seven crew members were killed. NASA had estimated that the probability of a catastrophic accident during launch, the most perilous portion of space flight, was 1 in 438.\n\nAt the time of his death, Onizuka held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n[edit]\n\nMemberships and distinctions\n\nOnizuka belonged to the following organizations: Society of Flight Test Engineers, the Air Force Association, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Tau, and Triangle Fraternity.\n\nAmong his distinctions are the Air Force Medallion of Merit, Air Force Service Medallion, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, and National Defense Service Medal.\n[edit]\n\nLegacy\n\nOnizuka Air Force Station in Sunnyvale, California, Onizuka Center for International Astronomy at the Mauna Kea Observatory and the Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center at Kona International Airport in Hawaii are named after him. Also named in his honor in fiction is a shuttle in Star Trek: The Next Generation, carried aboard USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D.\n\nTwo astronomical features were also named after him: an asteroid discovered by Edward L. G. Bowell on February 8, 1984, 3355 Onizuka and a 29 km diameter crater on the moon, Onizuka Crater. Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, California also has a street named after him.\n\nThe main protagonist of the manga Great Teacher Onizuka also bears a similar name - Eikichi Onizuka. It is likely that Eikichi's ability to withstand most degrees of physical injury may have been inspired by Ellison's legacy.")

In each of his flights, his role was as a mission specialist, usually as a payload specialist.\n\nHis first space flight was in 1990 on STS-41, the 11th flight of shuttle Discovery. He was instrumental in deploying the European Space Agency satellite Ulysses, a solar-exploration craft, as well as tending several secondary payloads and experiments.\n\nHis next mission was in 1992 on STS-49, the maiden flight of shuttle Endeavour. A primary goal of that mission was to capture and repair the non-functional Intelsat VI-F3 satellite. The first two attempts failed; Akers joined the third attempt which was successful. This marks the first three-person EVA in human history and was also the longest EVA (8 hours, 29 minutes) ever conducted to that time. As of January, 2004, it is now the second longest EVA, and is still the only instance of a three-person EVA.\n\nOn Akers' third mission in 1993 on STS-61, the 5th flight of Endeavour, he was one of four mission specialists who repaired and upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope on its first servicing mission. Akers spent just under 13.5 hours outside the Endeavour in two EVAs.\n\nHis last mission was in 1996 on STS-79, the 17th flight of shuttle Atlantis. This was the fourth shuttle flight to rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir and the first to exchange US astronauts with Mir, returning Shannon Lucid to earth and leaving John Blaha.\n\nAkers retired from NASA in 1997 and the Air Force in 1999 at the rank of Colonel, taking a position as instructor of Mathematics at the University of Missouri - Rolla.\n[edit]\n\nExternal links\n\n    * Astronaut bio: T.

He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), was the Orbiter flight engineer (MS-2) on STS-65 (1994), was a mission specialist on STS-79 (1996), and served as flight engineer on ISS Expedition 4 (2001-2002). Carl Walz and fellow astronaut Dan Bursch currently hold the U.S. space flight endurance record of 196 days in space.\n[edit]\n\nSpace Flight Experience\n\nSTS-51 Discovery (September 12-22, 1993). During the mission, the five-member crew deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Walz also participated in a 7-hour space walk (EVA) to evaluate tools for the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. The mission was accomplished in 9 days, 22 hours, and 12 minutes.\n\nSTS-65 Columbia (July 8-23, 1994). STS-65 flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) spacelab module, and carried a crew of seven. During the 15-day flight the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission completed 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles, setting a new flight duration record for the Shuttle program.\n\nSTS-79 Atlantis (September 16-26, 1996). On STS-79 the six-member crew aboard Atlantis docked with the Russian Mir station, delivered food, water, U.S. scientific experiments and Russian equipment, and exchanged NASA long duration crewmembers. During the mission, the Atlantis/Mir complex set a record for docked mass in space. STS-79 was the first flight of the double Spacehab module, and landed at KSC after 10 days 3 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nThe Expedition 4 crew launched on December 5, 2001 aboard STS-108 and docked with the International Space Station on December 7, 2001. During a 6-1/2 month stay aboard the Space Station, the crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The crew spent 196 days in space establishing a U.S. space flight endurance record for Carl Walz and crew mate Dan Bursch. Wearing the Russian Orlan space suit, Walz logged 11 hours and 52 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition 4 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002.")

In 1993, Dr. Dunbar served as Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. In February 1994, she traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent 13-months training as a back-up crew member for a 3-month flight on the Russian Space Station, Mir. In March 1995, she was certified by the Russian Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center as qualified to fly on long duration Mir Space Station flights. From October 1995 to November 1996, she was detailed to the NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate as Assistant Director where she was responsible for chairing the International Space Station Training Readiness Reviews, and facilitating Russian/American operations and training strategies. Currently, Dr. Dunbar serves as Assistant Director to the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) with a focus on University Research.\n\nA veteran of five space flights, Dr. Dunbar has logged more than 1,208 hours (50 days) in space. She served as a mission specialist on STS-61-A in 1985, STS-32 in 1990, and STS-71 in 1995, and was the Payload Commander on STS-50 in 1992, and STS-89 in 1998.\n[edit]\n\nSpace flight experience\n\nSTS-61-A Challenger (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dr. Dunbar was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS-61-A launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the Earth.\n\nSTS-32 Columbia (January 9-20, 1990), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Base in California. During the flight, the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also operated a variety of middeck experiments including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR), and the IMAX Camera. Dr. Dunbar was principal investigator for the MDE/FEA Experiment. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 10 days, 21 hours, 01 minute, 38 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 173 orbits of the Earth.\n\nSTS-50 Columbia (June 25 to July 9, 1992). Dr. Dunbar was the Payload Commander on STS-50, the United States Microgravity Lab-1 mission which was dedicated to microgravity fluid physics and materials science. Over 30 experiments sponsored by over 100 investigators were housed in the Spacelab in the Shuttle's Payload Bay. A payload crew of four operated around-the-clock for 13 days performing experiments in scientific disciplines such as protein crystal growth, electronic and infrared detector crystal growth, surface tension physics, zeolite crystal growth, and human physiology. Mission duration was 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, traveling 5.7 million miles in 221 orbits of the Earth.\n\nSTS-71 Atlantis (June 27 to July 7, 1995), was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The Atlantis was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. Dr. Dunbar served as MS-3 on this flight which also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed medical evaluations on the returning Mir crew. These evaluations included ascertaining the effects of weightlessness on the cardio/vascular system, the bone/muscle system, the immune system, and the cardio/pulmonary system. Mission duration was 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds, traveling 4.1 million miles in 153 orbits of the earth.\n\nSTS-89 Endeavour (January 22-31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle Endeavour to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth. Dr. Dunbar was the Payload Commander, responsible for all payload activities including the conduct of 23 technology and science experiments.")

Korzun\n\nValery Grigorievich Korzun (Russian: Валерий Григорьевич Корзун), Russian Air Force Colonel and cosmonaut of Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, was born March 5, 1953, in Krasny Sulin. Korzun and his wife Elana have one son, Nikita. His father is Korzun Grigori Andreevich, and his mother, Korzun Maria Arsentievna.\n[edit]\n\nEducation\n\n1974 graduate of the Kachin Military Aviation College; Commander Department of the Gagarin Air Force Academy, 1987.\n[edit]\n\nSpecial Honors\n\nAwarded six Air Force Medals.\n[edit]\n\nExperience\n\nAfter graduation from the Military College in 1974, he served as pilot, senior pilot, flight section leader, and ultimately Commander of a Russian Air Force squadron. In 1987, after a successful tour as Commander of the Gagarin Military Air-Force Academy, he was selected as a cosmonaut for training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center.\n\nIn December 1987 he began cosmonaut training and was certified as a Test-Cosmonaut in June 1989.\n\nFrom September 1989 through September 1992, he trained for space flight as part of the test-cosmonauts group and fom October 1992 to March 1994 he underwent extensive training as Commander of the \"Soyuz TM\" rescue spacecraft. He also trained as a group member for flight onboard the orbital complex Mir from March 1994 to June 1995.\n\nKorzun also served as deputy Director of the 27KC crew flight training complex as crew communication supervisor from March 1994 to January 1995.\n\nKorzun is a 1st class military pilot and has logged 1473 hours, primarily in 4 aircraft types. He is also an Instructor of Parachute Training, and has completed 377 parachute jumps.\n\nIn August 1996 Korzun completed training as Commander for the Mir-22/ NASA-3 and \"Cassiopia\" (sponsored by CNES) programs.\n\nOn March 2, 1997 Korzun returned to earth after completing a 197-day flight onboard the Mir space station. The program included joint flights with NASA/MIR 2, 3 and 4 astronauts, as well as astronauts from France and Germany. During the mission, Korzun performed 2 space walks totaling 12 hours and 33 minutes.\n\nThe Expedition 5 crew launched on June 5, 2002 aboard STS-111 and docked with the International Space Station on June 7, 2002. Korzun performed two EVAs during his six-month stay aboard the Space Station. He and Whitson installed six debris panels onto the ISS Zvezda Service Module. They removed the panels from their temporary location on the station's pressurized Mating Adapter 1 prior to attachment to Zvezda. The panels are designed to shield Zvezda from potential space debris impacts. On his second EVA he and Sergei Treschev installed a frame on the outside of the Zarya Module to house components for future spacewalk assembly tasks. They installed new material samples on a pair of Japanese Space Agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of Zvezda. They installed devices on Zvezda that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks. They also improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on Zvezda. The Expedition-Five crew (one American Astronaut and two Russian Cosmonauts) returned to Earth on December 7, 2002 aboard STS-113. Completing his second flight, Korzun logged 184 days, 22 hours and 14 minutes in space, including two EVAs totaling 9 hours and 46 minutes.\n\nDECEMBER 2002")

It lasted almost 11 days, and crew members made five EVA sorties, an all-time record. Even the spectacular Intelsat IV retrieval of STS-49 in May 1992 required only four. To be on the safe side, the flight plan allowed for two additional sorties which could have raised the total number to seven EVA's but the final two contingency EVA's turned out not to be necessary. In order to bring off this exploit without too much fatigue, the five extravehicular working sessions were shared between two alternating shifts of two astronauts.\n\nAfter launch on 2 December 1993, the astronauts carried out a series of checks on the vehicle and went to sleep seven and a half hours after liftoff.\n\nOn Flight day Two (2 December 1993) Endeavour performed a series of burns that allowed the shuttle to close in on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a rate of 60 nautical miles (111 km) per every 95 minute orbit. The crew made a detailed inspection of the payload and checked out both the robot arm and the spacesuits. Cabin pressure was also dropped 45% in preparation for the spacewalks on Flight Day Three. All of Endeavour's systems functioned well as the crew got a full day's sleep in preparation for the evening's rendezvous. At the end of Flight Day 2, Endeavour was 190 nautical miles (352 km) behind HST and closing.\n\nOn Flight Day Three, HST was sighted by astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman using a pair of binoculars and he noted that the right-hand solar array was bent in a 90 degree angle. These 12 m (40 ft) solar arrays, built by the European Space Agency (ESA), are planned to be replaced during the second spacewalk because they wobble 16 times a day each time the telescope heats up and cools off as it passes from the dark side of the Earth to its light side and vice versa.\n\nThe closing speed remained the same until the next reaction control system firing, at 8:34 p.m. CST (MET 1/17:07). The NH burn changed the shuttle's velocity by 4.6 ft/s (1.4 m/s), adjusting the high point of Endeavour's orbit and fine-tuning its course toward a point 40 miles (64 km) behind HST. The next burn, an orbital maneuvering system firing designated NC3, was scheduled for 9:22 p.m. (MET 1/17:55) and changed Endeavour's velocity by 12.4 ft/s (3.8 m/s). Endeavour's catch-up rate was adjusted to about 16 nautical miles (30 km) per orbit and put it 8 nautical miles (15 km) behind HST two orbits later. A third burn of just 1.8 ft/s (549 mm/s), called NPC and designed to fine tune two spacecrafts' ground tracks, at for 9:58 p.m. CST (MET 1/18:31). The multiaxis RCS terminal initiation or \"TI\" burn, which places Endeavour on an intercept course with HST and set up Commander Dick Covey's manual control of the final stages of the rendezvous, occurred at 12:35 am (MET 1/21:08).Commander Richard O. Covey maneuvered Endeavour within 30 ft (10 m) of the free-flying HST before Mission Specialist Claude Nicollier used Endeavour's robot arm to grapple the telescope at 3:48 am EST when the orbiter was several hundred km east of Australia over the South Pacific. Nicollier berthed the telescope in the shuttle's cargo bay at 4:26 am EST.\n\nEarlier in the day, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at the Goddard Space Flight Center uplinked commands to stow HST's two high-gain antennae. Controllers received indications that both antennae had nested properly against the body of the telescope, but microswitches on two latches of one antenna and one latch on the other did not send the \"ready to latch\" signal to the ground. Controllers decided not to attempt to close the latches, as the antennae are in a stable configuration. The situation is not expected to affect plans for rendezvous, grapple and servicing of the telescope.\n\nHST was captured by Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier shortly before 5 am EST on 4 December 1993 and everything has gone on schedule for the first planned spacewalk scheduled for 11:52 pm EST on 4 December 1993. After capture additional visual inspections were performed using the camera mounted on the 50 ft (15 m) long shuttle remote manipulator arm.\n\nStory Musgrave and Jeffrey A. Hoffman started the first EVA about an hour earlier than scheduled by stepping into the cargo bay at 10:46 pm EST. They began by unpacking tools, safety tethers and work platforms. Hoffman then installed a foot restraint platform onto the end of the shuttle's remote manipulator arm which he then snapped into his feet. Nicollier drove the arm from within the shuttle and moved Hoffman around the telescope. Meanwhile, Musgrave installed protective covers on Hubble's aft low gain antenna and on exposed voltage bearing connector covers. The astronauts then opened the HST equipment bay doors and installed another foot restraint inside the telescope. Musgrave assisted Hoffman into the restraint and Hoffman proceeded to replace two sets of Remote Sensing Units. These units contain gyroscopes that help keep Hubble pointed in the right direction. By 12:24 EST Hoffman had finished swapping out RSU-2 (containing Gryo's 2-3 & 2-4) and then swapped out RSU-3 (containing Gryo's 3-5 & 3-6). The astronauts then spent about 50 minutes preparing equipment for use during the second space walk and then replaced a pair of electrical control units (ECU3 and ECU1) that control RSU's 3 and 1. The astronauts also changed out eight fuse plugs that protect the telescope's electrical circuits. Hubble now has a full set of six healthy gyroscopes.\n\nThe astronauts struggled with the latches on the gyro door when two of four gyro door bolts did not reset after the astronauts installed two new gyro packages. Engineers who evaluated the situation speculated that when the doors were unlatched and opened, a temperature change might have caused them to expand or contract enough to keep the bolts from being reset.\n\nWith the efforts of determined astronauts in Endeavour's payload bay and persistent engineers on the ground, all four bolts finally latched and locked after the two spacewalkers worked simultaneously at the top and bottom of the doors. Musgrave anchored himself at the bottom of the doors with a payload retention device which enabled him to use some body force against the doors. Hoffman, who was attached to the robot arm, worked at the top of the doors. The duo successfully latched the doors when they simultaneously latched the top and bottom latches.\n\nThe spacewalkers also set up the payload bay for mission specialists Tom Akers and Kathy Thornton who replaced the telescope's two solar arrays during the second spacewalk which began at 10:35 pm EST today. The solar arrays provide power to the telescope. In anticipation of that spacewalk, Musgrave and Hoffman prepared the solar array carrier which is located in the forward portion of the cargo bay, and attached a foot restraint on the telescope to assist in the solar array replacement.\n\nMusgrave and Hoffman's spacewalk became the second longest spacewalk in NASA history lasting 7 h 50 min. The longest spacewalk occurred on STS-49 in May 1992 during Endeavour's maiden flight. Spacewalking crew members during that flight were Thomas D. Akers, Richard J. Hieb and Pierre J. Thuot. A number of spacewalks have since surpassed these. (See List of spacewalks and moonwalks)\n\nIn spite of the kink in array (about a panel and a half from the end), after a review by HST program managers, flight controllers decided to continue with the pre-flight plan and attempt to roll up and retract the solar arrays at the end of the first EVA. The stowage of the solar arrays is a two step process with the initial step involving the rolling up of the solar arrays and the second step involving the actual folding up of the arrays against the telescope. Each array stands on a four foot mast that supports a retractable wing of solar panels 12 m long and 2.5 m wide. They supply the telescope with 4.5kW of power.\n\nFlight Day 5 began on Sunday night (5 December 1993) at 10:35 EST. Astronauts Thomas D. Akers and Kathryn C. Thornton replaced HST's solar arrays during the second planned EVA (Thornton has red dashed stripes on her spacesuit while Tom Akers has diagonal red dashed stripes which helps flight controllers tell the two spacewalkers apart.) At the start of the EVA, the pressure in Thornton's vent garment was 0.2 lbf/in² (1.4 kPa) instead of the normal pressure of 4 to 6 lbf/in² (28 to 41 kPa). This was due to a possible ice plug in the suits plumbing which shortly melted. Thornton then topped off her suit. There were also other problems with Thornton's EVA suit. Her communications receiver malfunctioned in a way that allowed her to communicate to Akers but not to Mission Control. The crew decided to use a technique of relaying all commands for Thornton via Akers instead of switching to the backup comm channel. The backup channel is used for suit biomedical telemetry and would have limited Mission Control's ability to monitor that telemetry.\n\nAkers started the EVA by installing a foot restraint on the RMA for Thornton and proceeded to begin disconnecting 3 electrical connectors and a clamp assembly on the solar array. He had a slight problem with the clamp assembly but had the connectors demated by 11:17 pm EST. Thornton held the array in place so that it would not drift freely after being detached. The solar arrays weigh 160 kg (352 lb) and are 5 m long when folded. The astronauts dismounted the damaged array at 11:40 pm EST above the Saraha Desert (during a nighttime pass to minimize electrical activity) and Thornton held the array until the next daylight pass (approximately 12 min) before throwing it overboard at 11:52 pm EST over Somalia. The jettison during daylight allowed the astronauts and flight controllers to accurately track its position and relative velocity. The release by Thornton imparted a 1 ft/s (305 mm/s) velocity to the arrays and then the orbiter did a small burn with the RCS that imparted an additional 4 ft/s (1.2 m/s). The array, moving away from Endeavour at 5 ft/s (1.5 m/s), will separate about 11 to 12 miles (18 to 19 km) each orbit. The crew then installed a new array, (finishing around 1:40 EST) and rotated the telescope 180 degrees. They then replaced the second solar array which was stowed away for return to ESA. After the 6.5 hour EVA, successful functional tests were performed by the Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) on four of HST's 6 Gryos. Gryos 1&2 were not able to be tested due to the orientation of the telescope and were tested during the crew sleep period Monday afternoon (6 December 1993).\n\nFlight Day 6 EVA # 3 began Monday night (6 December 1993) AT 10:34 pm EST while Endeavour was over Australia. Hoffman installed guide studs on the Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC) and prepared the WFPC for removal while Musgrave setup a work platform and worked on opening an access door to allow observation of WFPC status lights. Hoffman attached the support handle to the WFPC and, with assistance by Claude Nicollier on the arm and a free floating Story Musgrave, removed the WFPC during the night pass starting at 11:41 pm EST. The WFPC was clear of the telescope by 11:48 pm EST and moved back into its storage container. A protective hood was then removed on the new WFPC (protecting its fragile external mirror) and the new 620 lb (280 kg) WFPC was then installed at 1:05 am EST. Ground controllers then ran an Aliveness Test and 35 minutes later reported that the new camera successfully performed its series of initial tests. The new Wide Field and Planetary Camera has a higher rating than the previous model, especially in the ultraviolet range, and includes its own spherical aberration correction system.\n\nFollowing the WFPC installation, Hoffman changed out two magnetometers on board HST. The magnetometers, which are located at the top of the telescope, are the satellite's \"compass\". They enabling HST to find its orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. Both original units were suffering from problems of background noise. During installation, 2 pieces pealed off the magnetometers. The EVA lasted 6 hours and 47 min.\n\nFlight Day 7 EVA # 4 began Tuesday night (7 December 1993) while Endeavour was flying over Egypt at 10:13 pm EST with Thornton and Akers. The primary task of the EVA was to replace HST's High Speed Photometer (HSP) with a device called COSTAR. This acronym stands for the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement system and the unit corrects HST's spherical aberration of the main mirror for all instruments except the WFPC-II camera, which has its own built in corrective optics. Akers received a go for the opening of HST's -V2 aft shroud doors at 10:45 pm EST. The doors were scheduled to be opened during a night pass to minimize thermal changes and reduce the possibility of out-gassing of components that could contaminate the optics. The High Speed Photometer (HSP) was powered down at 10:54 pm EST and the door opening started at 10:57 EST. Shortly after partially opening the door, the astronauts practiced reclosing the door. The door exhibited the same reluctance upon closing that was experience on different doors during previous EVA's. The doors were fully opened by 11:00 pm EST and 4 power and data connectors plus 1 ground strap were disconnected from the HSP. The HSP was removed at 11:27 pm EST and then reinserted to practice for the COSTAR installation. HSP was then parked on the side of the payload bay while COSTAR was removed from stowage and successfully installed in the HST by about 12:35 am EST. The astronauts closed out the HST equipment bay doors and stowed the HSP. At 2:25am EST they started upgrading HST's onboard computer by bolting on an electronics package containing additional computer memory and a co-processor. The computer system was then reactivated and passed its aliveness and functional tests at 4:41 am EST. The EVA was 100% successful and lasted for 6 h 50 min. It will be 6-9 weeks before optical alignments can confirm that HST is completely repaired.\n\nPilot Kenneth D. Bowersox, using Endeavour's RCS system, performed two orbital manueuvers and boosted HST from a 321 by 317 nautical mile (594 by 587 km) orbit to a 321.7 by 320.9 nautical mile (596 by 594 km) circular orbit at 9:14 pm EST. COSTAR functional tests were also completed. There was some concern about the health of the onboard HST DF-224 computer and recently installed memory and co-processor when a memory dump failed. After much analysis by a team at the GSFC, it was determined that the dump failure was due to noise on the communications link between the spacecraft and the ground.\n\nFlight Day 8 EVA #5 began on Wednesday night (8 December 1993) at 10:14 pm with a go for airlock depress over the Indian Ocean with Musgrave and Hoffman performing the EVA. Story Musgrave's EVA suit failed its initial leak check and Story performed steps on the 5 lbf/in² (34 kPa) contingency checklist. He rotated the EVA suits lower arm joints and the suit passed 2 subsequent leak checks. The EVA started at 10:30 EST and lasted 7 h 21 min.\n\nMusgrave's and Hoffman's first task was to replace the solar array drive electronics and they began the SADE operation while ground controllers initiated the first step in solar array deployment by commanding the Primary Drive Mechanism (PDM). Endeavour was placed in free drift to disable any RCS firings that could disrupt the solar arrays and the PDM motors were engaged at 10:48 pm. The latches were unlocked but the arrays failed to rotate to the deploy position. No motion was detected and the STOCC sent commands to drive a single array with two motors with no success. Finally, the astronauts cranked the deployment mechanism by hand and deploy was successful. After the SADE was swapped out, the crew fitted an electrical connection box on the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph at 3:30 am EST and it passed its aliveness test. The crew then installed some covers on the magnetometers, fabricated onboard by Claude Nicollier and Kenneth D. Bowersox. These covers will contain any debris caused by the older magnetometers that show some signs of UV decay. The EVA ended at 5:51 am EST bringing the total EVA time for this mission to 35 h 28 min. The HST High Gain Antenna (HGA) was deployed at 6:49 am EST and completed by 6:56 am EST. Release time for HST was set for 2:08 am EST.\n\nFlight Day 9 began on Thursday night (9 December 1993) but concerns about one of HST's four onboard Data Interface Units (DIU's) delayed release. The DIU's are 35 lb (16 kg) electronic units that transfer data between HST's main computer, solar arrays and other critical systems. A failure on Side A of DIU # 2 experienced erratic current fluctuations and some data dropouts. Controllers at the STOCC and mission control came up with a troubleshooting procedure to determine the extent of the problem. HST was transferred to internal power and disconnected from its power umbilical at 11:43 pm EST. Controllers then switched channels on the DIU from the A side to the B side and then back to the A side. They determined HST should be deployed. The drum brakes on the new Solar Array were applied to prevent them from vibrating during future observations. Claude Nicollier then took hold of the satellite with the robot arm. Hubble was switched back to internal power mode and the umbilical cord linking it to the Shuttle was disconnected. The satellite was then lifted and moved away from Endeavour. The telescope's aperture door was then reopened (a 33 min procedure) and then released at 5:26 am EST. Commander Dick Covey and pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox fired Endeavour's small maneuvering jets and moved the shuttle slowly away from HST. The next servicing visit to HST is scheduled for 1997. Landing occurred on Runway 33 at 12:26 am on 13 December 1993.\n[edit]\n\nTrivia\n\nThis mission was the first to use a computer-controlled space tool, the Power Ratchet Tool (PRT).

	(biography "Richard O. Covey\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nRichard O. Covey (born August 1, 1946) is a former NASA astronaut.\n\nBorn in Fayetteville, Arkansas, he considers Fort Walton Beach, Florida, to be his hometown. He graduated from Choctawhatchee High School, Shalimar, Florida, in 1964; received a bachelor of science in engineering sciences with a major in astronautical engineering from the United States Air Force Academy in 1968, and a master of science in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue University in 1969.\n\nAs a member of the US Air Force, Covey was an operational fighter pilot 1970-1974, flying the F-100, A-37, and A-7D. He flew 339 combat missions during two tours in Southeast Asia. At Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, between 1975 and 1978, he was an F-4 and A-7D weapons system test pilot and joint test force director for electronic warfare testing of the F-15 Eagle. He has flown over 5,700 hours in more than 30 different types of aircraft.\n\nSelected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, Covey became an astronaut in August 1979. A veteran of four space flights, STS-51-I in 1985, STS-26 in 1988, STS-38 in 1990, and STS-61 in 1993, Covey has logged over 646 hours in space.\n\nPrior to the first flight of the Space Shuttle, he provided astronaut support in Orbiter engineering development and testing. He was a T-38 chase pilot for the second and third Shuttle flights and support crewman for the first operational Shuttle flight, STS-5. Covey also served as Mission Control spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for Shuttle Missions STS-5, 6, 61-B, 61-C, and 51-L. During 1989, he was Chairman of NASA's Space Flight Safety Panel. He has held additional technical assignments within the Astronaut Office, and has also served as Acting Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, and Acting Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations.\n\nEffective August 1, 1994, Covey retired from NASA and the Air Force. Covey is married and has two grown daughters.\n[edit]\n\nSpace flights\n\nOn his first mission, Covey was the pilot on the five-man crew of STS-51-I, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 27, 1985. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed three communications satellites: the Navy SYNCOM IV-4, the Australian AUSSAT, and American Satellite Company's ASC-1. The crew also performed the successful on-orbit rendezvous and repair of the ailing 15,000 pound (6.8 t) SYNCOM IV-3 satellite. This repair activity involved the first manual grapple and manual deployment of a satellite by a spacewalking crew member. Mission duration was 170 hours. Space Shuttle Discovery completed 112 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1985.\n\nHe next served as pilot on STS-26, the first flight to be flown after the Challenger accident. The five-man crew launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 29, 1988, aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. Mission duration was 97 hours during which crew members successfully deployed the TDRS-C satellite and operated eleven secondary payloads which included two student experiments. Discovery completed 64 orbits of the Earth before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 3, 1988.\n\nOn STS-38 Covey was the spacecraft commander of a five-man crew which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five-day mission crew members conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, Covey piloted the Space Shuttle Atlantis to a landing on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990. This was the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985.\n\nOn his fourth flight, Covey commanded a crew of seven aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on the STS-61 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and repair mission. STS-61 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1993. During the 11-day flight, the HST was captured and restored to full capacity through a record five space walks by four astronauts. After having traveled 4,433,772 miles (7,135,464 km) in 163 orbits of the Earth, Covey landed the Endeavour at night on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center on December 13, 1993.")

He completed astronaut academic training and then worked on the design and development of the Skylab Program. He was the backup science-pilot for the first Skylab mission, and was a CAPCOM for the second and third Skylab missions. Musgrave participated in the design and development of all Space Shuttle extravehicular activity equipment including spacesuits, life support systems, airlocks and manned maneuvering units. From 1979 to 1982, and 1983 to 1984, he was assigned as a test and verification pilot in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory at JSC. He served as a spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-31, STS-35, STS-36, STS-38 and STS-41, and lead CAPCOM for a number of subsequent flights. He was a mission specialist on STS-6 in 1983, STS-51-F/Spacelab-2 in 1985, STS-33 in 1989 and STS-44 in 1991, was the payload commander on STS-61 in 1993, and a mission specialist on STS-80 in 1996. A veteran of six space flights, Musgrave has spent a total of 1281 hours 59 minutes, 22 seconds in space. He left NASA in August 1997 to pursue private interests.\n\nHe first flew on STS-6, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, on April 4, 1983, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 9, 1983. During this maiden voyage of Space Shuttle Challenger, the crew performed the first Shuttle deployment of an IUS/TDRS satellite, and Musgrave and Don Peterson conducted the first Space Shuttle extravehicular activity (EVA) to test the new space suits and construction and repair devices and procedures. Mission duration was 5 days, 23 minutes, 42 seconds.\n\nOn STS-51F/Spacelab-2, the crew aboard Challenger launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. This flight was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission, and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments in astronomy, astrophysics, and life sciences. During this mission, Musgrave served as the systems engineer during launch and entry, and as a pilot during the orbital operations. Mission duration was 7 days, 22 hours, 45 minutes, 26 seconds.\n\nOn STS-33, he served aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989. This classified mission operated payloads for the United States Department of Defense. Following 79 orbits, the mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a landing at sunset on Runway 04 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 5 days, 7 minutes, 32 seconds.\n\nSTS-44 also launched at night on November 24, 1991. The primary mission objective was accomplished with the successful deployment of a Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) rocket booster. In addition the crew also conducted two Military Man in Space Experiments, three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous medical tests to support longer duration Shuttle flights. The mission was concluded in 110 orbits of the Earth with Atlantis returning to a landing on the lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 1, 1991. Mission duration was 6 days, 22 hours, 50 minutes, 42 seconds.\n\nSTS-61 was the first Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and repair mission. Following a night launch from Kennedy Space Center on December 2, 1993, the Endeavour rendezvoused with and captured the HST. During this 11-day flight, the HST was restored to its full capabilities through the work of two pairs of astronauts during a record 5 spacewalks. Dr. Musgrave performed 3 of these spacewalks. After having travelled 4,433,772 miles in 163 orbits of the Earth, Endeavour returned to a night landing in Florida on December 13, 1993. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 59 minutes.\n\nOn STS-80 (November 19 to December 7, 1996), the crew aboard Space Shuttle Columbia deployed and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The free-flying WSF created a super vacuum in its wake in which to grow thin film wafers for use in semiconductors and the electronics industry. The ORFEUS instruments, mounted on the reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars. In completing this mission he logged a record 278 earth orbits, traveled over 7 million miles in 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes.\n\nMusgrave is the only astronaut to have flown missions on all five Space Shuttles. Prior to John Glenn's return to space in 1998 Musgrave held the record for the oldest person in orbit, at age 62. He retired from NASA in 1997.")

Prather Award in 1994\n    * Freedom Forum Free Spirit Award in 1994\n    * American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Support Systems Award in 1995\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademic Experience\n\nHoffman's original research interests were in high-energy astrophysics, specifically cosmic gamma ray and x-ray astronomy. His doctoral work at Harvard was the design, construction, testing, and flight of a balloon-borne, low-energy, gamma ray telescope.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1975, during post-doctoral work at Leicester University, he worked on several x-ray astronomy rocket payloads. He also designed and supervised the construction and testing of the test equipment for use in an x-ray beam facility which he used to measure the scattering and reflectivity properties of x-ray concentrating mirrors. During his last year at Leicester, he was project scientist for the medium-energy x-ray experiment on the European Space Agency's EXOSAT satellite and played a leading role in the proposal and design studies for this project.\n\nHe worked in the Center for Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1975 to 1978 as project scientist in charge of the orbiting HEAO-1 A4 hard x-ray and gamma ray experiment, launched in August 1977. His involvement included pre-launch design of the data analysis system, supervising its operation post-launch, and directing the MIT team undertaking the scientific analysis of flight data being returned. He was also involved extensively in analysis of x-ray data from the SAS-3 satellite being operated by MIT. His principal research was the study of x-ray bursts, about which he authored or co-authored more than 20 papers.\n[edit]\n\nNASA Experience\n\nSelected by NASA in January 1978, Dr. Hoffman became an astronaut in August 1979. During preparations for the Shuttle Orbital Flight Tests, he worked in the Flight Simulation Laboratory at Downey, California, testing guidance, navigation and flight control systems. He worked with the orbital maneuvering and reaction control systems, with Shuttle navigation, with crew training, and with the development of satellite deployment procedures. Dr. Hoffman served as a support crewmember for STS-5 and as a CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for the STS-8 and STS-82 missions. Dr. Hoffman has been the Astronaut Office Payload Safety Representative. He also worked on EVA, including the development of a high-pressure spacesuit, and preparations for the assembly of the Space Station. Dr. Hoffman was a co-founder of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group. In 1996 he led the Payload and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office.\n\nDr. Hoffman left the astronaut program in July 1997 to become NASA's European Representative in Paris, where he served until August 2001. His principle duties were to keep NASA and NASA’s European partners informed about each other’s activities, try to resolve problems in US-European cooperative space projects, search for new areas of US-European space cooperation, and represent NASA in European media. In August 2001, Dr. Hoffman was seconded by NASA to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is a Professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is engaged in several research projects using the International Space Station and teaches courses on space operations and design.\n[edit]\n\nSpace Flight Experience\n\nDr. Hoffman made his first space flight as a mission specialist on STS 51-D, April 12-19, 1985, on the Space Shuttle Discovery. On this mission, he made the first STS contingency spacewalk, in an attempted rescue of a malfunctioning satellite.\n\nDr. Hoffman made his second space flight as a mission specialist on STS-35, December 2-10, 1990, on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This Spacelab mission featured the ASTRO-1 ultraviolet astronomy laboratory, a project on which Dr. Hoffman had worked since 1982.\n\nDr. Hoffman made his third space flight as payload commander and mission specialist on STS-46, July 31-August 8, 1992, on the Space Shuttle Atlantis. On this mission, the crew deployed the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA), an ESA-sponsored free-flying science platform, and carried out the first test flight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS), a joint project between NASA and the Italian Space Agency. Dr. Hoffman had worked on the Tethered Satellite project since 1987.\n\nDr. Hoffman made his fourth flight as an EVA crewmember on STS-61, December 2-13, 1993, on the Space Shuttle Endeavour. During this flight, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was captured, serviced, and restored to full capacity through a record five space walks by four astronauts.\n\nDr. Hoffman last flew on STS-75 (February 22 - March 9, 1996) on the Space Shuttle Columbia. This was a 16-day mission whose principal payloads were the reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS) and the third flight of the United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-3). The TSS successfully demonstrated the ability of tethers to produce electricity. The TSS experiment produced a wealth of new information on the electrodynamics of tethers and plasma physics before the tether broke at 19.7 km, just shy of the 20.7 km goal. The crew also worked around the clock performing combustion experiments and research related to USMP-3 microgravity investigations. During this mission, Dr. Hoffman became the first astronaut to log 1000 hours aboard the Space Shuttle.\n\nWith the completion of his fifth space flight, Dr. Hoffman has logged more than 1,211 hours and 21.5 million miles in space.")

HST was placed in orbit on April 24th, 1990 by the Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-31. The first servicing mission was done by Space Shuttle Endeavour on STS-61. Work performed on the telescope significantly upgraded the scientific capabilities of the HST and helped to keep the telescope functioning smoothly until the next scheduled servicing missions, which were STS-103 in 1999 and STS-109 in 2002.\n\nStarting on the third day of the mission, the seven-member crew were to conduct four spacewalks (also called Extravehicular Activities or EVAs) to remove two older instruments and install two new astronomy instruments, as well as other servicing tasks. The two older instruments being replaced are the Goddard High Resolution Spectrometer and the Faint Object Spectrograph. Replacing these instruments are the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). HST's current complement of science instruments includes two cameras, two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors.\n\nIn addition to installing the new instruments, astronauts will replace other existing hardware with upgrades and spares. Hubble received a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor, an optical device that is used on HST to provide pointing information for the spacecraft and is used as a scientific instrument for astrometric science. The Solid State Recorder (SSR) will replace one of HST's current reel-to-reel tape recorders. The SSR provides much more flexibility than a reel-to-reel recorder and can store ten times more data. One of Hubble's four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) will be replaced with a refurbished spare. The RWA is part of Hubble's Pointing Control Subsystem. The RWAs use spin momentum to move the telescope into position. The wheels also maintain the spacecraft in a stable position. The wheel axes are oriented so that the telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating, if required.\n[edit]\n\nMission Results\n\nSTS-82 demonstrated anew the capability of the Space Shuttle to service orbiting spacecraft as well as the benefits of human spaceflight. The crew completed servicing and upgrading of the Hubble Space Telescope during four planned extravehicular activities (EVAs) and then performed a fifth unscheduled space walk to repair insulation on the telescope.\n\nHST deployed in April 1990 during STS-31. It was designed to undergo periodic servicing and upgrading over its 15-year lifespan, with first servicing performed during STS-61 in December 1993. Hawley, who originally deployed the telescope, operated the orbiter Remote Manipulator System arm on STS-82 to retrieve HST for second servicing at 3:34 a.m. EST, Feb. 13, and positioned it in payload bay less than half an hour later.\n\nRelying on more than 150 tools and crew aids, Lee and Smith performed EVAs 1, 3 and 5, and Harbaugh and Tanner did EVAs 2 and 4. EVA 1 began at 11:34 p.m. EST, February 13th, and lasted six hours, 42 minutes. One of Hubble's solar arrays was unexpectedly disturbed by gust of air from Discovery's airlock when it was depressurized, but was not damaged. Lee and Smith removed two scientific instruments from Hubble, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS), and replaced them with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), respectively. STIS expected to shed further light on supermassive black holes. NICMOS features more capable infrared detectors and will give astronomers their first clear view of the universe at near infrared wavelengths between 0.8 and 2.5 micrometers.\n\nEVA 2 began at 10:25 p.m., February 14th, and lasted seven hours, 27 minutes. Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a degraded Fine Guidance Sensor and a failed Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with new spares. Also installed a new unit called the Optical Control Electronics Enhancement Kit, which will further increase the capability of the Fine Guidance Sensor. During this EVA astronauts noted cracking and wear on thermal insulation on side of telescope facing sun and in the direction of travel.\n\nEVA 3 began at 9:53 p.m., February 15th, and lasted seven hours, 11 minutes. Lee and Smith removed and replaced a Data Interface Unit on Hubble, as well as an old reel-to-reel- style Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) that will allow simultaneous recording and playback of data. Also changed out one of four Reaction Wheel Assembly units that use spin momentum to move telescope toward a target and maintain it in a stable position. After this EVA, mission managers decided to add EVA 5 to repair the thermal insulation on HST.\n\nEVA 4 began at 10:45 p.m., February 16th, and lasted six hours, 34 minutes. Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a Solar Array Drive Electronics package which controls the positioning of Hubble's solar arrays. Also replaced covers over Hubble's magnetometers and placed thermal blankets of multi-layer material over two areas of degraded insulation around the light shield portion of the telescope just below the top of the observatory. Meanwhile, inside Discovery Horowitz and Lee worked on the middeck to fabricate new insulation blankets for HST.\n\nFinal space walk, EVA 5, lasted five hours, 17 minutes. Lee and Smith attached several thermal insulation blankets to three equipment compartments at the top of the Support Systems Module section of the telescope which contain key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. STS-82 EVA total of 33 hours, 11 minutes is about two hours shy of total EVA time recorded on first servicing mission.\n\nDiscovery's maneuvering jets fired several times during mission to reboost telescope's orbit by eight nautical miles. Hubble redeployed on Feb. 19 at 1:41 a.m. and is now operating at the highest altitude it has ever flown, a 335- by 321-nautical-mile orbit. Initial checkout of new instruments and equipment during mission showed all were performing nominally. Calibration of two new science instruments was to take place over a period of several weeks with first images and data anticipated in about eight to 10 weeks.\n[edit]\n\nRelated articles\n\n    * Space science\n    * Space shuttle\n    * List of space shuttle missions\n    * List of human spaceflights chronologically\n\n[edit]\n\nExternal links\n\n    * NASA mission summary\n\nPrevious Mission:\nSTS-81 	Space Shuttle program 	Next Mission:\nSTS-83\nRetrieved from \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-82\"\n\nCategories: Human spaceflights | Space Shuttle program | Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions\nViews\n\n    * Article\n    * Discussion\n    * Edit this page\n    * History\n    * Move\n    * Watch\n\nPersonal tools\n\n    * Twinbee\n    * My talk\n    * Preferences\n    * My watchlist\n    * My contributions\n    * Log out\n\nNavigation\n\n    * Main Page\n    * Community portal\n    * Current events\n    * Recent changes\n    * Random article\n    * Help\n    * Contact us\n    * Donations\n\nSearch\n \nToolbox\n\n    * What links here\n    * Related changes\n    * Upload file\n    * Special pages\n    * Printable version\n    * Permanent link\n\nIn other languages\n\n    * Deutsch\n\nMediaWiki\nWikimedia Foundation\n\n    * This page was last modified 20:29, 19 July 2005.\n    * All text is available under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (see Copyrights for details).\n    * About Wikipedia\n    * Disclaimers")

	(biography "Mark C. Lee\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nJump to: navigation, search\nPicture of Lee from NASA biography\nEnlarge\nPicture of Lee from NASA biography\n\nColonel Mark C. Lee USAF, (born August 14, 1952) is a former NASA astronaut who flew as part as four space shuttle missions. He retired from the Air Force and NASA on July 1, 2001.\n[edit]\n\nLife prior to astronaut training\n\nLee was born in Viroqua, Wisconsin and graduated from Viroqua High School in 1970. He later attended the U.S. Air Force Academy where he received a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from the in 1974. Following pilot training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and F-4 upgrade at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, Lee spent 2-1/2 years at Okinawa Air Base, Japan, flying F-4’s in the 25th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In 1979, after this assignment, he studied for a master of science degree in mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he specializd in graphite/epoxy advanced composite materials.\n\nAfter graduation from MIT in 1980, he was assigned to Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, in the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) Program Office, as the operational support manager. His responsibilities included resolving mechanical and material deficiencies which affected the mission readiness of the AWACS aircraft. In 1982 he returned to flying, upgrading in the F-16 and serving as executive officer for the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing Deputy Commander for Operations, and as flight commander in the 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, until his selection as an astronaut candidate.\n[edit]\n\nAstronaut training and beyond\n\nLee was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in May 1984. In June 1985, he completed a one-year training and evaluation program, qualifying him for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. His technical responsibilities within the Astronaut Office included extravehicular activity (EVA), the inertial upper stage, Spacelab and Space Station systems. Lee also served as a spacecraft communicator in the Mission Control Center, as Lead Astronaut Support Person at the Kennedy Space Center, Chief of Astronaut Appearances, Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch, Chief of the EVA Robotics Branch, and Chief of the EVA Branch. He also worked Space Station assembly issues for the Astronaut Office.\n\nIn total, during his four space flights, Lee traveled over 13 million miles going around the world 517 times and spending 33 days in orbit. Lee's first shuttle mission was as a mission specialist on STS-30 (May 4-8, 1989). This mission involved the launch of the Magellan probe, a Venus-exploration spacecraft and experiments involving life sciences and crystals. In his second flight, mission STS-47, running from September 12 - 20, 1992, Lee was payload commander with overall crew responsibility for the planning, integration, and on-orbit coordination of payload/Space Shuttle activities. This cooperative mission between the United States and Japan included 44 Japanese and U.S. life science and materials processing experiments and the shuttle carried spacelab-J.\n\nLee was a mission specialist on his third flight, mission STS-64, running from September 9 - 20, 1994. During this flight he logged 6 hours and 51 minutes of EVA to test a self-rescue jetpack, undertook the first untethered spacewalk in 10 years and deployed and retrieved a solar science satellite. Lee's final flight was STS-82, running from February 11 - 21, 1997. This was the second Hubble Space Telescope maintenance mission and Lee again served as payload commander. He was a member of one of two spacewalk teams who installed two new spectrometers and eight replacement instruments, as well as replacing insulation patches over three compartments containing key data processing, electronics and scientific instrument telemetry packages. Lee's contribution amounted to three space walks totaling 19 hours and 10 minutes of EVA.\n[edit]\n\nMedals and honors\n\nLee has been awarded a number of medals and honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal. He has also received two Air Force Commendation Medals, four NASA Space Flight Medals, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, the NASA Public Service Group Achievement Award, and two NASA Exceptional Service Medals.")

	(description "Voyager 1\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nJump to: navigation, search\nA NASA artist's rendition of a Voyager spacecraft\nEnlarge\nA NASA artist's rendition of a Voyager spacecraft\n\nThe Voyager 1 spacecraft is an 815-kilogram unmanned probe of the outer solar system and beyond, launched September 5, 1977, and currently operational. It is the farthest human-made object from Earth. The Voyager 1 spacecraft has moved into the solar system's final frontier, a vast area where the Sun's influence gives way to interstellar space. At 14 billion kilometers (95 astronomical units or 8.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Voyager 1 has entered the heliosheath, a region beyond termination shock – the critical boundary that marks the transition from the solar system into interstellar space. At this distance, signals from Voyager 1 take more than thirteen hours to reach its control center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a joint project of NASA and Caltech near Pasadena, California. Voyager 1 is on a hyperbolic trajectory and has achieved escape velocity, meaning that its orbit will not return to the inner solar system. Along with Pioneer 10, the now deactivated Pioneer 11, and its sister ship Voyager 2, Voyager 1 is becoming an interstellar probe.\n\nVoyager 1 had as its primary targets the planets Jupiter and Saturn and their associated moons and rings; its current mission is the detection of the heliopause and particle measurements of solar wind and the interstellar medium. Both Voyager probes are powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which have far outlasted their originally intended lifespan, and are now expected to continue to generate enough power to keep communicating with Earth until around the year 2020.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Mission planning and launch\n    * 2 Jupiter\n    * 3 Saturn\n    * 4 Interstellar mission\n          o 4.1 Heliopause\n          o 4.2 Distance travelled\n    * 5 See also\n    * 6 External links\n\n[edit]\n\nMission planning and launch\n\nVoyager 1 was originally planned as Mariner 11 of the Mariner program. From the outset, it was designed to take advantage of the then-new technique of gravity assist. By fortunate chance, the development of interplanetary probes coincided with an alignment of the planets called the Grand Tour. The Grand Tour was a linked series of gravity assists that, with only the minimal fuel needed for course corrections, would enable a single probe to visit all four of the solar system's gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The identical Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes were designed with the Grand Tour in mind, and their launches were timed to enable the Grand Tour if desired.\n\nVoyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977 by NASA from Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan IIIE Centaur rocket, slightly after its sister craft, Voyager 2. Despite being launched after Voyager 2, Voyager 1 was sent on a faster trajectory so it reached Jupiter and Saturn before its sister craft.\n\nInitially, an underburn in the second stage of the Titan IIIE rocket left an estimated one second worth of fuel remaining in that stage. Although ground crews were worried that Voyager 1 would not make it to Jupiter, the Centaur upper stage proved to have enough fuel to compensate.\n\nFor details on the Voyager instrument packages, see the separate article on the Voyager program.\n[edit]\n\nJupiter\nDetail of Jupiter's atmosphere, as imaged by Voyager 1.\nEnlarge\nDetail of Jupiter's atmosphere, as imaged by Voyager 1.\n\nVoyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979. Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of 349,000 kilometers (217,000 miles) from its center. Due to the greater resolution allowed by close approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and radiation environment of the Jupiter system were made in the 48-hour period bracketing closest approach. It finished photographing the planet in April.\n\n\nThe two Voyager spacecraft made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter and its satellites. The most surprising was the existence of volcanic activity on Io, which had not been observed from the ground or by Pioneer 10 or 11.\n[edit]\n\nSaturn\nVoyager 1 image of Saturn from 5.3 million km four days after its closest approach.\nEnlarge\nVoyager 1 image of Saturn from 5.3 million km four days after its closest approach.\n\nThe gravity assist at Jupiter was successful, and the spacecraft went on to visit Saturn. Voyager 1's Saturn flyby occurred in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12 when it came within 124,000 kilometers (77,000 miles) of the planet's cloud-tops. The craft detected complex structures in Saturn's rings, and studied the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. Because of the earlier discovery of a thick atmosphere on Titan, the Voyager controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory elected for Voyager 1 to make a close approach of Titan and terminate its Grand Tour. (For the continuation of the Grand Tour, see the Uranus and Neptune sections of the Voyager 2 article.) The Titan-approach trajectory caused an additional gravity assist that took Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic, thus ending its planetary science mission.\n[edit]\n\nInterstellar mission\n\nIt is estimated both Voyager craft would have sufficient electrical power to operate at least some instruments until 2020.\n[edit]\n\nHeliopause\nVoyager 1 is in the heliosheath\nEnlarge\nVoyager 1 is in the heliosheath\n\nAs the Voyager 1 space probe heads for interstellar space, its instruments continue to study the solar system; Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists are using the plasma wave experiments aboard Voyager 1 and 2 to look for the heliopause.\n\nScientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab believe that Voyager entered the termination shock in February 2003. Some other scientists have expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. In a scientific session at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans on the morning of March 25, 2005, Dr. Ed Stone presented clear evidence that Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock in December 2004 [1]. The issue will not be resolved for some months as other data become available, since Voyager's solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. However, in May 2005 a NASA press release said that consensus was that Voyager 1 was now in the heliosheath. [2].\n[edit]\n\nDistance travelled\n\nIn March 2005, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 14.2 billion kilometers (95.0 AU or 8.83 billion miles) from the Sun, which makes it the most distant man-made object from Earth. It was travelling at a speed of 17.2 kilometers per second (3.6 AU per year or 38,400 miles per hour), 10% faster than Voyager 2. It is not heading straight towards any particular star, but even if Voyager 1 were going straight toward the closest star system, Alpha Centauri, it would take about 80,000 years to get there.")

	(description "A GOLDEN PHONOGRAPH CONTAINING DATA ABOUT THE HUMAN SPECIES\n\nVoyager Golden Record\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\nJump to: navigation, search\nThe Voyager Golden Record.\nEnlarge\nThe Voyager Golden Record.\nCover of the Voyager Golden Record.\nEnlarge\nCover of the Voyager Golden Record.\n\nThe Voyager Golden Record is a gramophone record, attached to the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977, containing sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth. It is intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form that may find it. The Voyagers will take about 40,000 years to come close to another star, hence if other beings do not come our way to meet them, it will take at least that long if the Golden Record is found.\n\nAs the probe it is attached to is relatively small and will be all but lost in the vastness of interstellar space, it is extraordinarily unlikely that it will ever be intercepted. If it is ever found by an alien species, it will be far in the future, and thus the record is best seen as a symbolic statement rather than a serious attempt to communicate with aliens.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Background\n    * 2 Contents\n    * 3 Journey\n    * 4 Other information\n    * 5 Appearances in fiction\n    * 6 References\n    * 7 See also\n    * 8 External links\n\n[edit]\n\nBackground\n\nThe Voyager spacecraft will be the third and fourth human artifacts to escape entirely from the solar system. Pioneers 10 and 11, which were launched in 1972 and 1973 and preceded Voyager in outstripping the gravitational attraction of the Sun, both carried small metal plaques identifying their time and place of origin for the benefit of any other spacefarers that might find them in the distant future.\n\nWith this example before them, NASA placed a more comprehensive (and eclectic) message aboard Voyager 1 and 2 – a kind of time capsule, intended to communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials.\n\n    This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. — U.S. President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\n\n[edit]\n\nContents\n\nThe contents of the record were selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell University. Dr. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind, and thunder, and animal sounds, including the songs of birds and whales. To this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earth-people in fifty-five languages, and printed messages from President Carter and U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim.\n\nAfter NASA had received much criticism over the \"smut\" on the Pioneer plaque (line drawings of a naked man and woman), the agency chose not to allow Sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and a nude, pregnant woman on the record. Instead, only a silhouette of the couple was included (Jon Lomberg: \"Pictures of Earth\". in Carl Sagan: Murmurs of Earth, 1978, New York, ISBN 0679744444).\n\nHere is an excerpt of President Carter's official statement placed on the Voyager spacecraft for its trip outside our solar system, June 16, 1977: \"We cast this message into the cosmos . . . Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy, some - - perhaps many - - may have inhabited planets and space faring civilizations. If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message: We are trying to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope some day, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of Galactic Civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nThe 115 images are encoded in analog form. The remainder of the record is audio, designed to be played at 16⅔ revolutions per minute. It contains spoken greetings beginning with Akkadian, which was spoken in Sumer about six thousand years ago, and ending with Wu, a modern Chinese dialect.\n\nFollowing are the 55 languages included in the Golden Record:\n\n    * Sumerian\n    * Arabic\n    * Urdu\n    * Italian\n    * Ila (Zambia)\n    * Akkadian\n    * Romanian\n    * Hindi\n    * Nguni\n    * Nyanja\n    * Hittite\n    * French\n    * Vietnamese\n    * Sotho\n    * Swedish\n    * Hebrew\n    * Burmese\n    * Sinhalese\n    * Wu\n    * Ukrainian\n    * Aramaic\n    * Spanish\n    * Greek\n    * Korean\n    * Persian\n    * English\n    * Indonesian\n    * Latin\n    * Armenian\n    * Serbian\n    * Portuguese\n    * Quechua\n    * Japanese\n    * Polish\n    * Luganda\n    * Cantonese\n    * Dutch\n    * Punjabi\n    * Nepali\n    * Amoy (Min dialect)\n    * Russian\n    * German\n    * Turkish\n    * Mandarin Chinese\n    * Marathi\n    * Thai\n    * Bengali\n    * Welsh\n    * Gujarati\n    * Kannada\n    * Telugu\n    * Oriya\n    * Hungarian\n    * Czech\n    * Rajasthani\n\nFollowing the section on the sounds of Earth, there is an eclectic 90-minute selection of music from many cultures, including Eastern and Western classics.

It is now in empty space, with forty thousand years expected to elapse before it or Voyager 2 makes a close approach to any other solar system.\n\nThe Voyagers are identical but on different flight paths. In May 2005, Voyager 1 was 8.7 billion miles from the Sun and traveling at a speed of 3.6 AU per year while Voyager 2 is about 6.5 billion miles away and moving at about 3.3 AU per year. One 'AU' equals the distance between the Sun and Earth, or 93 million miles.\n\nVoyager 1 has entered the heliosheath, the region beyond the termination shock. The termination shock is where the solar wind, a thin stream of electrically charged gas blowing continuously outward from the Sun, is slowed by pressure from gas between the stars. At the termination shock, the solar wind slows abruptly from its average speed of 300 to 700 km per second (700,000 - 1,500,000 miles per hour) and becomes denser and hotter. [1]\n\nAs Carl Sagan has noted, \"The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space. But the launching of this 'bottle' into the cosmic 'ocean' says something very hopeful about life on this planet.\"\n\nSome others suggest that the only civilization that will encounter it will be our own, when in a few hundred years it is retrieved and placed into a space museum.\n[edit]\n\nOther information\n\nMost of the images used on the record (reproduced in black and white), together with information about its compilation, can be found in the book Murmurs of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record by Carl Sagan, F.D. Drake, Ann Druyan, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg, and Linda Salzman (1978), ISBN 0394410475 (hardcover); ISBN 0345283961 (paperback). A CD-ROM version was issued by Warner New Media in 1992.\n\nIn July, 1983, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the 45-minute documentary Music from a Small Planet, in which Sagan and Druyan explained the process of selecting music for the record and introduced excerpts. It was not clear whether this was an original BBC documentary or an imported NPR production.\n[edit]\n\nAppearances in fiction\n\nThe motion picture Starman portrayed the Voyager Golden Record as having been located by an extra-terrestial intelligence who subsequently sent one of their own race to investigate intelligent life on Earth.\n\nVoyager and its record appear in the episode entitled Parasites Lost of the cartoon show Futurama. Leela scrapes the spacecraft off her ship's windshield while stopped at a galactic \"truck stop\".\n\nIn the Transformers series Beast Wars, one of the fabled \"Golden Disks\" the Predacon group held was the Voyager Record. This disk was prized by the Transformer race, as it alone told the location of Earth and thus the source of all Energon as well as containing a secret message from the original Megatron who - realizing his own ultimate defeat was near and learning about Cybertron's 'transwarp' experiments - inscribed the disk with a specific order to any remaining Decepticons to use the Disk and the emerging transwarp technology to travel back in time and change history so that Decepticons would win the war instead. The other disc was an alien artifact. This was 'spelled out' later in the series, although a close examination of the discs in earlier episodes made it clear as well.\n\nWhile parts of the Record cover appear in Star Trek: The Motion Picture as part of V'ger, the Record itself was apparently not placed on the Voyager 6 probe.\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n    * Originally based on public domain text from the NASA Website, where selected images and sounds from the record can be found.
